# Current State Before Architecture Refactor

## Summary
We've identified and partially fixed major issues with the notes system. About to refactor to a proper normalized architecture.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. NotesDebugPage.tsx
- **Issue**: Supabase client was limiting results to 1000 records
- **Fix**: Implemented pagination to fetch all records
- **Issue**: "Unassigned" count was incorrect (1827 â†’ 240)
- **Fix**: Updated filter logic to include user_id in relationship checks

### 2. Database Issues Discovered
- **Issue**: 1728 duplicate notes out of 3312 total records
- **Root Cause**: Migration script using INSERT instead of UPSERT
- **Partial Fix**: Cleaned up duplicates, currently have 1584 unique notes

### 3. Migration Script Issues
- **Issue**: Constraint was `UNIQUE (sf_content_note_id)` but we need to allow same note with multiple object relationships
- **Current Fix**: Changed to `UNIQUE (sf_content_note_id, sf_content_document_link_id)`
- **Architectural Problem**: Still storing duplicate note content - needs normalization

### 4. Documentation Added
- **MIGRATION_BEST_PRACTICES.md**: Comprehensive UPSERT patterns and anti-patterns
- **DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md**: Updated with migration warnings

## Current Database State
- **Total notes**: ~1584 (after deduplication)
- **Constraint**: Updated to composite key
- **Issue**: Still using denormalized structure that duplicates note content

## Next Steps (About to Start)
1. **Normalize Architecture**: Split into `note` + `note_object_link` tables
2. **Update Migration Script**: Extract unique notes first, then relationships
3. **Update Application Code**: Modify queries to JOIN normalized tables
4. **Clean Architecture**: One note record per unique Salesforce note

## Files to Keep
- `_master_migration_script.sql` (modified, needs further refactor)
- `src/pages/NotesDebugPage.tsx` (modified)
- `MIGRATION_BEST_PRACTICES.md` (new documentation)
- `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` (updated)

## Files to Clean Up
All temporary SQL files created during investigation and cleanup.
