# Contact Management Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 9, 2025
**Session Focus:** Adding comprehensive contact management to property details

---

## Overview

Implemented a complete contact management system for properties, including the ability to add existing contacts, create new contacts, and remove contacts from properties. The system works consistently across both the main property detail page and the map-based property view.

---

## Components Created/Modified

### 1. **AddContactsModal.tsx** (NEW)
**Location:** `/workspaces/react-kanban-board/src/components/property/AddContactsModal.tsx`

**Purpose:** Modal for adding contacts to properties with search and multi-select functionality

**Features:**
- Search contacts by name, email, or company (debounced, 300ms)
- Shows up to 5 search results
- Multi-select with checkboxes
- Batch add multiple contacts at once
- "+ New Contact" button opens ContactFormModal sidebar
- Clean modal UI with backdrop
- Shows count of selected contacts in footer
- Add button disabled until contacts are selected

**Key Functions:**
- `handleToggleContact()` - Select/deselect contacts

- Added `showAddContactsModal` state
- Added `showContactModal` state for creating new contacts
- Updated "+ Add New" button to open AddContactsModal
- Integrated ContactFormModal for creating new contacts
- Removed old AddPropertyContactModal references

**Key Functions:**
- `handleRemoveContact()` - Deletes from property_contact table (not contact table)
- `loadData()` - Refreshes all sidebar data (contacts, deals, site submits)

**UI Updates:**
- Contacts section with "+ Add New" button
- Trash icon on hover for removing contacts (no need to expand)
- Modals for adding and creating contacts

---

### 3. **StaticContactsSidebar.tsx** (MODIFIED)

---

### 4. **PropertyDetailScreenWithStaticSidebar.tsx** (MODIFIED)
**Location:** `/workspaces/react-kanban-board/src/components/property/PropertyDetailScreenWithStaticSidebar.tsx`

**Purpose:** Property detail screen used when clicking properties from the map

**Changes Made:**
- Added tab navigation with "Details" and "Contacts" tabs
- Added `activeTab` state ('details' | 'contacts')
- Moved all property detail sections into "Details" tab
- Created "Contacts" tab showing StaticContactsSidebar component
- Tabs styled with blue underline for active state

**Tab Structure:**
```tsx
<div className="mb-4 border-b border-gray-200">
  <nav className="flex space-x-8">
    <button onClick={() => setActiveTab('details')}>Details</button>
    <button onClick={() => setActiveTab('contacts')}>Contacts</button>
  </nav>
</div>

{activeTab === 'details' && (
  // All property sections
)}

{activeTab === 'contacts' && (
  <StaticContactsSidebar propertyId={propertyId} />
)}
```

## User Workflows

### Workflow 1: Adding Existing Contacts
1. User clicks "+ Add" or "+ Add New" button
2. AddContactsModal opens with search box
3. User types to search contacts (searches name, email, company)
4. Results show with checkboxes
5. User selects multiple contacts
6. User clicks "Add (X)" button
7. All selected contacts added to property_contact table
8. Modal closes, contacts list refreshes

### Workflow 2: Creating New Contacts
1. User clicks "+ Add" or "+ Add New" button
2. AddContactsModal opens
3. User clicks "+ New Contact" button (in modal footer or when no results)
4. ContactFormModal slides in from right
5. User fills in contact details
6. User saves contact
7. Contact automatically associated with property (via propertyId prop)
8. ContactFormModal closes
9. AddContactsModal closes
10. Contacts list refreshes

### Workflow 3: Removing Contacts
1. User hovers over contact in list
2. Trash icon appears on right side (between name and chevron)
3. User clicks trash icon
4. Confirmation dialog appears: "Remove this contact from the property? The contact will not be deleted, only the association."
5. User confirms
6. Record deleted from property_contact table (contact record remains in contact table)
7. Contact removed from list immediately

## Database Schema

### Tables Used

**property_contact** (junction table)
- `id` - Primary key
- `property_id` - Foreign key to property
- `contact_id` - Foreign key to contact
- `created_at` - Timestamp
- `created_by_id` - Foreign key to user
- `updated_at` - Timestamp
- `updated_by_id` - Foreign key to user

**contact**
- `id` - Primary key
- `first_name`
- `last_name`
- `email`
- `phone`
- `mobile_phone`
- `title`
- `company`
- Other fields...

---

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Modal vs Inline Search
**Tried:** Inline search input that appears in the sidebar
**Result:** Too cluttered, hard to see results
**Final:** Modal with clean search interface and multi-select

### 2. Single vs Multi-Select
**Decision:** Multi-select with checkboxes
**Reason:** More efficient to add multiple contacts at once
**Implementation:** Checkboxes with blue selection styling

### 3. Remove Button Placement
**Tried:** "Remove" button in expanded contact details
**User Feedback:** "a trash can without expanding would be better"
**Final:** Trash icon on hover (opacity-0 → opacity-100 on group-hover)

### 4. Tab vs Sidebar for Map View
**User Request:** "I don't see that Contacts tab"
**Solution:** Added tab navigation to PropertyDetailScreenWithStaticSidebar
**Implementation:** Two tabs: "Details" and "Contacts"

## Known Issues / Future Enhancements

### Known Issues
None currently - all features working as expected

### Future Enhancements
1. Could add ability to mark a contact as "Primary Contact" from the list
2. Could add inline editing of contact details
3. Could add bulk remove functionality
4. Could show contact activity/history
5. Could add contact roles/types (e.g., "Owner", "Property Manager")

---

## Development Notes

### Component Architecture
- **AddContactsModal**: Stateless, controlled by parent components
- **PropertySidebar**: Manages its own modal states
- **StaticContactsSidebar**: Similar to PropertySidebar but simpler
- **ContactFormModal**: Shared across the app, accepts propertyId for auto-association

### State Management
- Each parent component manages its own modal visibility states
- Data fetching done at component level (no global state)
- Optimistic UI updates where possible

### Styling Patterns
- Blue for primary actions (Add buttons, selected states)
- Red for destructive actions (trash icon, remove)
- Gray for neutral/disabled states
- Consistent spacing and shadows across modals

### Searching Contacts
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('contact')
  .select('id, first_name, last_name, email, phone, mobile_phone, title, company')
  .or(
    `first_name.ilike.%${searchTerm}%,last_name.ilike.%${searchTerm}%,email.ilike.%${searchTerm}%,company.ilike.%${searchTerm}%`
