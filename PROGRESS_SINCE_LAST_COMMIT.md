# Progress Documentation Since Last Commit (9070f48 - "major mapping improvements")

## Summary
Fixed critical "Submitted-Reviewing" site submit visibility issue and implemented comprehensive mapping UI improvements. The user was unable to see "Submitted-Reviewing" site submits on the map after running a migration script.

---

## 🔧 **Database & Migration Fixes**

### `_master_migration_script.sql` (+83 lines)
- **MAJOR FIX**: Added global "Submitted-Reviewing" stage restoration
- **Problem**: Previous migration accidentally broke "Submitted-Reviewing" stage mapping
- **Solution**:
  - Ensures "Submitted-Reviewing" stage exists in `submit_stage` table using proper upsert logic
  - Maps ALL site submits globally (not just specific clients) that have `sf_submit_stage = 'Submitted-Reviewing'`
  - Handles stage name variations (`Submitted - Reviewing`, `Submitted Reviewing`, etc.)
  - Provides detailed reporting of fixes applied
  - Uses `INSERT ... SELECT ... WHERE NOT EXISTS` pattern (safe for multiple runs)
- **Impact**: Restores visibility of all "Submitted-Reviewing" site submits across all clients
