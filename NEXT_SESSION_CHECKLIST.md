# Next Session Checklist - Assignment to Deal Conversion

## üéØ Quick Start for Next Session

### What We Accomplished
‚úÖ Implemented complete assignment-to-deal conversion feature
‚úÖ Fixed all Supabase query errors (409 conflict, multiple FK issues, field name issues)
‚úÖ Added site submit ‚Üí deal linking (critical fix)
‚úÖ Added property unit copying from site submit
‚úÖ Added assignment priority auto-update to "Converted"
‚úÖ Committed all code to git (commit: f8a4397)
‚úÖ Created comprehensive documentation

### What You Need to Test

#### 1. **Test the Complete Conversion Flow** (HIGH PRIORITY)
```
1. Navigate to an existing assignment that has site submits
2. Click the green "Convert to Deal" button at the bottom
3. Verify the modal opens with:
   - Pre-filled deal name (assignment name)
   - Target close date picker (optional)
   - Site submit dropdown showing only this assignment's site submits
4. Select a site submit from the dropdown
5. Click "Create Deal"
6. Verify you're navigated to the new deal page
7. Check the deal details to confirm:
   - Deal name matches what you entered
   - Deal value copied from assignment
   - Commission and referral fee copied
   - Property and property unit linked
   - Site submit linked
   - Stage is "Negotiating LOI"
   - Probability is 50
8. Navigate back to the assignment
9. Verify assignment shows:
   - Linked to the new deal
   - Priority changed to "Converted"
10. Check the site submit record
11. Verify site submit shows:
    - Linked to the new deal
    - Stage changed to "LOI"
```

#### 2. **Test Error Handling**
- Try converting without selecting a site submit
- Try converting an assignment with no site submits
- Try converting an assignment with no client

#### 3. **Investigate Deal Deletion** (MENTIONED BUT NOT RESOLVED)
You mentioned issues with deleting deals. Try:
1. Navigate to a deal details page
2. Try to delete the deal
3. Note any errors in console or UI
4. Check if it's specific to deals created from assignments

### Files to Review

**Main Implementation:**
- `src/components/ConvertToDealModal.tsx` - The conversion modal (400+ lines)
- `src/components/AssignmentDetailsForm.tsx` - Button integration

**Documentation:**
- `SESSION_NOTES_2025-10-14.md` - Complete session notes and debugging log
- `ASSIGNMENT_TO_DEAL_CONVERSION.md` - Feature documentation with field mappings
- `NEXT_SESSION_CHECKLIST.md` - This file

### Known Issues to Address

#### ‚úÖ RESOLVED in this session:
- [x] Site submits not loading (fixed Supabase query)
- [x] Site submit not linking to deal (added deal_id update)
- [x] 409 conflict error (removed manual timestamps)

#### ‚ùì TO INVESTIGATE:
- [ ] Deal deletion issue (you mentioned this but had to leave)
- [ ] End-to-end testing needed

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Build
npm run build

# Check git status
git status

# View commit
git show f8a4397

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main
```

### Database Schema Notes

**Key Foreign Keys Added/Modified:**
- `deal.assignment_id` ‚Üí `assignment.id` (backlink)
- `deal.site_submit_id` ‚Üí `site_submit.id` (one-way)
- `deal.property_unit_id` ‚Üí `property_unit.id` (new)
- `assignment.deal_id` ‚Üí `deal.id` (backlink)
- `assignment.priority_id` ‚Üí `assignment_priority.id` (updated)
- `site_submit.deal_id` ‚Üí `deal.id` (backlink - ADDED THIS SESSION)
- `site_submit.submit_stage_id` ‚Üí `submit_stage.id` (updated)

### Questions to Ask User

1. **Deal Deletion**: What's the exact error when trying to delete a deal?
2. **Validation**: Should we prevent converting an already-converted assignment?
3. **UI**: Should we show a "Converted" badge on assignment list?
4. **Navigation**: Should assignment page show link to deal if converted?

## üêõ If Something Breaks

### Common Issues:

**"Cannot find module" error:**
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

**Supabase query errors:**
- Check console for exact error
- Verify table/column names in database-schema.ts
- Check foreign key relationships

**409 Conflict on conversion:**
- ‚úÖ Should be fixed - we removed manual timestamps
- If still happening, check for unique constraints on deal table

**Site submits not loading:**
- ‚úÖ Should be fixed - we corrected the query syntax
- Check that assignment has site submits with matching assignment_id
