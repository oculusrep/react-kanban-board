## Components Created

### 1. `AssignmentSelector.tsx`
**Location:** `src/components/mapping/AssignmentSelector.tsx`

**Purpose:** Reusable auto-suggest search component for selecting assignments

**Props:**
- `selectedAssignment` - Currently selected assignment
- `onAssignmentSelect` - Callback when assignment is selected/cleared
- `onCreateNew` - Callback for "+ Add New Assignment" button
- `placeholder` - Input placeholder text
- `className` - Additional CSS classes
- `limit` - Number of results to show (default: 5)
- `clientId` - Filter assignments by client ID

**Features:**
- Debounced search (300ms)
- Click-outside-to-close dropdown
- Keyboard navigation support
- Shows assignment name only (no subtext)
- Loads all assignments for client on focus

**Example Usage:**
```tsx
<AssignmentSelector
  selectedAssignment={selectedAssignment}
  onAssignmentSelect={(assignment) => {
    setSelectedAssignment(assignment);
    setFormData(prev => ({ ...prev, assignment_id: assignment?.id || null }));
  }}
  onCreateNew={() => setShowAddAssignmentModal(true)}
  placeholder="Search for assignment..."
  limit={5}
  clientId={selectedClient?.id || null}
/>
```

### 2. `AddAssignmentModal.tsx`
**Location:** `src/components/AddAssignmentModal.tsx`

**Purpose:** Modal dialog for creating new assignments

**Props:**
- `isOpen` - Controls modal visibility
- `onClose` - Callback to close modal
- `onSave` - Callback with created assignment data
- `preselectedClientId` - Pre-fills client if provided

**Form Fields:**
- **Required:** Assignment Name, Client
- **Optional:** Assignment Value, Priority, Due Date, Site Criteria

**Features:**
- Full form validation
- Client selector integration
- Pre-populates client from context
- Creates assignment in database
- Returns complete assignment object to caller
- Auto-closes on successful save

**Z-Index:** 70 (appears above slideouts)

### 3. `useAssignmentSearch.ts`
**Location:** `src/hooks/useAssignmentSearch.ts`

**Purpose:** Custom hook for assignment search operations

**Functions:**

#### `searchAssignments(query: string, clientId?: string | null)`
- Searches assignments by name (case-insensitive)
- Optionally filters by client ID
- Returns up to 10 results
- Includes: id, assignment_name, client_id, client_name, assignment_value, due_date, progress

#### `getAllAssignments(clientId?: string | null, limit: number = 50)`
- Fetches all assignments (or filtered by client)
- Returns up to specified limit
- Same return structure as searchAssignments

**State:**
- `loading` - Boolean indicating query in progress
- `error` - Error message string or null

**Database Approach:**
- Avoids nested joins (caused 400 errors)
- Fetches assignment data first
- Fetches client data separately
- Maps data together in JavaScript

### Routing & Navigation

#### 4. `App.tsx`
**Location:** `src/App.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added import: `AssignmentsReportPage`
- Added route: `/reports/assignments`

#### 5. `ReportsPage.tsx`
**Location:** `src/pages/ReportsPage.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Description: "View and filter all assignments by client and trade area"

### Type Definitions

#### 6. `types.ts`
**Location:** `src/lib/types.ts`

**No changes required** - Assignment interface already existed with all necessary fields including `assignment_id` foreign key.

---

## Database Integration

### Table: `assignment`
**Foreign Key:** `assignment_id` in `site_submit` table

### Fields Used:
- `id` (UUID, primary key)
- `assignment_name` (text)
- `client_id` (UUID, foreign key to client)
- `assignment_value` (numeric)
- `due_date` (date)
- `progress` (text)
- `commission` (numeric) - not displayed in selector
- `priority_id` (UUID, foreign key to assignment_priority)
- `owner_id` (UUID, foreign key to user)
- `transaction_type_id` (UUID, foreign key to transaction_type)

### Query Strategy

**Problem:** Nested joins caused 400 errors
```sql
-- ‚ùå This caused errors:
SELECT *, client:client_id(client_name) FROM assignment
```

**Solution:** Fetch data separately
```sql
-- ‚úÖ This works:
SELECT id, assignment_name, client_id, ... FROM assignment WHERE client_id = ?
SELECT id, client_name FROM client WHERE id IN (...)
```

### Related Tables:
- `client` - Assignment belongs to client
- `assignment_priority` - Priority levels (High, Medium, Low)
- `user` - Assignment owner
- `transaction_type` - Type of transaction
- `site_submit` - Can be associated with assignment
- `property` - Via site_submit, provides trade_area

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AssignmentSelector
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ useAssignmentSearch hook
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ searchAssignments()
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ getAllAssignments()
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Dropdown with results
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Assignment list (limit: 5)

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AddAssignmentModal
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ClientSelector
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Form fields
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Save button
```

### State Management

**PinDetailsSlideout / SiteSubmitDetailsPage:**
```typescript
const [selectedAssignment, setSelectedAssignment] = useState<AssignmentSearchResult | null>(null);
const [showAddAssignmentModal, setShowAddAssignmentModal] = useState(false);
const [hasChanges, setHasChanges] = useState(false); // Triggers save button
```

**AssignmentSelector:**
```typescript
const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
const [results, setResults] = useState<AssignmentSearchResult[]>([]);
const [showDropdown, setShowDropdown] = useState(false);
const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(-1); // For keyboard nav
```

### Data Flow

#### Loading Assignment:
```
Database (site_submit table)
  ‚Üì assignment_id
Fetch assignment data
  ‚Üì (separate queries)
Fetch client name
  ‚Üì
Set selectedAssignment state
  ‚Üì
Display in AssignmentSelector
```

#### Saving Assignment:
```
User selects assignment
  ‚Üì
setSelectedAssignment(assignment)
  ‚Üì
setFormData(prev => ({ ...prev, assignment_id: assignment.id }))
  ‚Üì
setHasChanges(true) ‚Üí Save button appears
  ‚Üì
User clicks "UPDATE SITE SUBMIT"
  ‚Üì
Database update with assignment_id
  ‚Üì
setHasChanges(false) ‚Üí "Submit Site" button reappears
```

### Error Handling

**400 Errors from Nested Joins:**
- **Problem:** `client:client_id(...)` syntax caused errors
- **Solution:** Fetch client data in separate query
- **Implementation:** All components now use this pattern

**Empty States:**
```typescript
// No client selected
{!selectedClient && (
  <p className="mt-1 text-xs text-gray-500">Select a client first</p>
)}

// No assignments found
<div className="p-2 text-sm text-gray-500">No assignments found</div>
```

**Loading States:**
```typescript
{loading ? (
  <div className="p-2 text-sm text-gray-500">Loading...</div>
) : (
  // Results
)}
```

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Debounced Search:** 300ms delay prevents excessive API calls
2. **Limited Results:** Shows only 5 assignments before "Add New"
3. **Conditional Loading:** Only fetches when client is selected
4. **Separate Queries:** Avoids expensive nested joins
5. **Pagination:** Report shows 50 records per page

### Console Logging

**Comprehensive logging for debugging:**

```typescript
// Loading
console.log('üìã Loading assignment for site submit:', id);
console.log('‚úÖ Loaded assignment data:', data);

// Searching
console.log('üîç Searching assignments for:', query, 'client:', clientId);
console.log('‚úÖ Found N assignments matching query');

// Saving
console.log('üíæ Saving site submit with assignment_id:', id);
console.log('‚úÖ Site submit saved successfully with assignment:', id);

// Errors
console.error('‚ùå Error loading assignment:', error);
```

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [selectedAssignment, setSelectedAssignment] = useState<AssignmentSearchResult | null>(null);
  const [selectedClient, setSelectedClient] = useState<ClientSearchResult | null>(null);

  return (
    <AssignmentSelector
      selectedAssignment={selectedAssignment}
      onAssignmentSelect={(assignment) => {
        setSelectedAssignment(assignment);
        // Update your form data
      }}
      onCreateNew={() => {
        // Open modal or navigate to create page
      }}

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [showModal, setShowModal] = useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setShowModal(true)}>
        Create Assignment
      </button>

      <AddAssignmentModal
        isOpen={showModal}
        onClose={() => setShowModal(false)}
        onSave={(newAssignment) => {
          console.log('Created:', newAssignment);
          // Use the new assignment

        }}
        preselectedClientId={clientId}
      />
    </>
  );
};
```

### Example 3: Loading Assignment from Database

```typescript
// In useEffect or data loading function
if (siteSubmitData.assignment_id) {
  const { data: assignmentData, error } = await supabase
    .from('assignment')
    .select('id, assignment_name, client_id, assignment_value, due_date, progress')
    .eq('id', siteSubmitData.assignment_id)
    .single();

  if (assignmentData && !error) {
    // Optionally fetch client name
    const { data: clientData } = await supabase
      .from('client')
      .select('client_name')
      .eq('id', assignmentData.client_id)
      .single();
