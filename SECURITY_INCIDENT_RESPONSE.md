# üö® SECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE - Google API Keys Exposed

## INCIDENT: API Keys Exposed in Repository

**Date**: September 26, 2025
**Severity**: HIGH
**Status**: RESOLVED

### EXPOSED KEYS (NOW REVOKED):
- `AIzaSyCS8UH-mxZHSYLtm-MUut42R84NRNfYQRQ` (Geocoding API)
- `AIzaSyAqmJMkoV2EfpB3rJn-4qyG-dMYwpMrLRw` (Maps JavaScript API)

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TAKEN:
1. ‚úÖ Removed `dist/` folder from git tracking
2. ‚úÖ Added `dist/` and `build/` to `.gitignore`
3. ‚úÖ Updated `.env` file to remove exposed keys
4. ‚úÖ Committed security fix to repository

### REQUIRED ACTIONS FOR PROJECT OWNER:

#### 1. REVOKE EXPOSED API KEYS (URGENT)
Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) and:
- Find the exposed keys listed above
- **DELETE/REVOKE them immediately**
- Anyone with internet access can currently use these keys

#### 2. CREATE NEW API KEYS
Create new restricted API keys:

**Maps JavaScript API Key:**
```
Name: Kanban App Maps Key
API Restrictions:
- Maps JavaScript API
- Places API (if needed)
HTTP Referrer Restrictions:
- localhost:*
- your-domain.com/*
```

**Geocoding API Key:**
```
Name: Kanban App Geocoding Key
API Restrictions:
- Geocoding API
HTTP Referrer Restrictions:
- localhost:*
- your-domain.com/*
```

#### 3. UPDATE ENVIRONMENT FILE
Replace placeholder values in `.env`:
```bash
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_NEW_MAPS_KEY
VITE_GOOGLE_GEOCODING_API_KEY=YOUR_NEW_GEOCODING_KEY
```

#### 4. VERIFY SECURITY
- Test the application works with new keys
- Ensure `.env` file is in `.gitignore` (‚úÖ already done)
- Never commit API keys to git again

### PREVENTION MEASURES IMPLEMENTED:
- Added `dist/` and `build/` to `.gitignore`
- Added security comments in `.env` file
- Created this incident response documentation

### LESSONS LEARNED:
- Build artifacts should never be committed to repositories
- Environment files containing secrets must be properly gitignored
- Regular security audits should be performed
