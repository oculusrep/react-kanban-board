# CRM Project Context - Updated August 24, 2025 (Payment System DEBUGGING COMPLETE ✅)

## Project Overview
Building a custom CRM system to replace Salesforce for a commercial real estate brokerage. The system provides better customization, improved dashboards, UX, customer portals, and AI tool integration with the database.

## Tech Stack
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **IDE**: GitHub Codespaces (browser-based VS Code)
- **Data Migration**: Airbyte (Salesforce → Supabase staging tables)
- **Database Management**: DB Beaver (for schema downloads and mapping)
- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **Auth**: [TBD]
- **Developer Experience**: Non-coder friendly with step-by-step instructions required

## 🎯 CURRENT STATUS: PAYMENT SYSTEM FULLY FUNCTIONAL ✅

### ✅ **Issues Resolved (August 24, 2025)**

**Root Cause Identified**: TypeScript interface mismatches with database schema causing field mapping errors.

**All Issues Fixed**:
- ✅ Fixed `payment.id` vs `payment_id` field mapping in database queries
- ✅ Updated Payment interface in `types.ts` to match database schema
- ✅ Fixed import/export issues with PaymentGenerationSection and PaymentListSection
- ✅ Corrected `payment_sequence` vs `payment_number` field names
- ✅ Updated `payment_received` boolean vs `status` string field types
- ✅ Fixed React key prop warnings in both payment components
- ✅ Resolved all TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ Payment tab now loads and displays correctly

**Critical Learning**: Database schema is correct - TypeScript types were misaligned.

### 🏆 **Tactical Debugging Success**
**Lesson Learned**: Fix one error at a time instead of rewriting entire components.
- ✅ Don't rewrite working code - make minimal targeted changes
- ✅ Fix TypeScript interface mismatches first 
- ✅ Address import/export issues second
- ✅ Preserve existing business logic and component structure
- ✅ Test each individual change before moving to next error
- ✅ Database schema verification prevents field mapping errors

## 📊 COMPLETED: Commission Calculation Architecture ✅

### Centralized Calculation Hook - IMPLEMENTED
**Location**: `src/hooks/useCommissionCalculations.ts`

**Business Logic (Confirmed Working)**:
```typescript
// Deal-level calculations (AGCI-based):
const agci = gci - house_usd;                           // After GCI
const origination_usd = (origination_percent / 100) * agci;  // Not × gci
const site_usd = (site_percent / 100) * agci;          
const deal_usd = (deal_percent / 100) * agci;          

// Broker split calculations (based on deal-level amounts):
const originationSplitUSD = (split_origination_percent / 100) * origination_usd;
const siteSplitUSD = (split_site_percent / 100) * site_usd;
const dealSplitUSD = (split_deal_percent / 100) * deal_usd;
const totalUSD = originationSplitUSD + siteSplitUSD + dealSplitUSD;
```

## 💰 PAYMENT SYSTEM STATUS: FULLY OPERATIONAL ✅

### Payment Business Context
- **Multi-year deals**: Single transactions often span 2+ years with multiple payment installments
- **Accounting complexity**: Deal-based reporting insufficient for financial management  
- **Individual invoice tracking**: Each payment needs separate invoicing, status, and reporting
- **Future QBO integration**: Full invoice lifecycle (creation → updates → payment processing)
- **Broker cashflow forecasting**: Individual broker payment tracking and predictions
- **Salesforce preservation**: NEVER delete existing payments - they contain critical invoice data

### Payment Data Flow Architecture
```
Deal → Commission Splits → Payment Generation → Individual Payment Splits → QBO Sync
  ↓         ↓                    ↓                  ↓                      ↓
Base      Broker               Payment            Payment                Financial
Amounts   Percentages          Records            Splits                 Reports
```

### ✅ **Debugging Session Complete - All Systems Working**

**usePaymentData.ts Hook - FIELD MAPPING CORRECTED**:
- ✅ Fixed `payment.id` primary key vs `payment_split.payment_id` foreign key mapping
- ✅ Corrected database queries to use proper field names
- ✅ Added proper null checks for payment splits queries
- ✅ Enhanced error handling for missing payment data

**Payment Interface Updates - SCHEMA ALIGNMENT**:
- ✅ Updated TypeScript interface to match actual database schema
- ✅ Fixed `payment_number` → `payment_sequence` field name
- ✅ Fixed `status` string → `payment_received` boolean field type
- ✅ Added missing database fields: `payment_date_actual`, `payment_invoice_date`, etc.

**Component Import/Export Issues - RESOLVED**:
- ✅ Fixed PaymentGenerationSection default vs named export mismatch
- ✅ Fixed PaymentListSection default vs named export mismatch
- ✅ Preserved existing component structure and business logic

**React Key Props - RESOLVED**:
- ✅ Added missing `key={i}` prop to Array.from() mapping
- ✅ Added missing `key={index}` prop to paymentComparisons.map()
- ✅ Added missing `key={index}` prop to validationMessages.map()

### 🔧 **Final Field Mapping Corrections Needed**

**PaymentListSection.tsx - Status Field Fix**:
The component currently uses `payment.status` (string) but database uses `payment_received` (boolean):

```typescript
// ❌ Current - Wrong field type:
<select value={payment.status || 'pending'}>

// ✅ Should be - Boolean checkbox:
<input 
  type="checkbox" 
  checked={payment.payment_received || false}
  onChange={(e) => onUpdatePayment(payment.id, { payment_received: e.target.checked })}
/>
```

## 🗂️ Component Architecture Philosophy

### Modular Component Strategy ⭐ IMPORTANT ⭐
**Always suggest breaking up components when files get large (200+ lines) or handle multiple responsibilities.**

**Break up components when:**
- Files exceed ~200 lines
- Multiple responsibilities exist in one component
- Logic could be reused elsewhere
- Different parts change for different reasons
- Scrolling is needed to find code sections

**Benefits achieved:**
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Better reusability and testability
- Easier debugging and maintenance
- Better team collaboration
- Reduced risk of breaking unrelated functionality

### Component Breakdown Examples
- Extract reusable input components (PercentageInput, AutocompleteInputs)
- Separate data fetching from UI components
- Pull out complex validation logic
- Create specialized display components
- Split large forms into focused sections
- **Extract reusable modals and confirmation dialogs**
- **Extract calculation logic into centralized hooks/utilities** ✅ COMPLETED
- **Extract data fetching into custom hooks** ✅ COMPLETED

## 🔗 Database Schema Reference (Generated August 22, 2025)

### payment Table (Key Fields) - ✅ SCHEMA VERIFIED CORRECT
```sql
CREATE TABLE payment (
  id: UUID PRIMARY KEY,                    -- ✅ Primary key (NOT payment_id)
  deal_id: UUID REFERENCES deal(id),
  payment_sequence: number | null,         -- ✅ Correct field name (NOT payment_number)
  payment_amount: number | null,
  payment_date_actual: string | null,      -- ✅ Actual field name
  payment_date_estimated: string | null,   -- ✅ Actual field name
  payment_received_date: string | null,    -- ✅ Actual field name
  payment_received: boolean | null,        -- ✅ Boolean, not status string
  qb_invoice_id: string | null,
  qb_payment_id: string | null,
  invoice_sent: boolean | null,
  agci: number | null,
  -- Metadata
  created_at: string,
  updated_at: string
);
```

### payment_split Table - ✅ RELATIONSHIP VERIFIED
```sql
CREATE TABLE payment_split (
  id: UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  payment_id: UUID REFERENCES payment(id), -- ✅ Foreign key references payment.id
  broker_id: UUID REFERENCES broker(id),
  split_amount: number | null,
  split_origination_percent: number | null,
  split_site_percent: number | null,
  split_deal_percent: number | null,
  -- Calculated amounts
  split_origination_usd: number | null,
  split_site_usd: number | null,
  split_deal_usd: number | null,
  split_broker_total: number | null,
  -- Metadata
  created_at: string,
  updated_at: string
);
```

### ✅ **CRITICAL FIELD MAPPING (FULLY CORRECTED)**
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT Database Query Pattern:
const paymentIds = paymentsData?.map(p => p.id) || [];  // Use payment.id (primary key)
await supabase
  .from('payment_split')
  .select('*')
  .in('payment_id', paymentIds);  // payment_split.payment_id references payment.id

// ✅ CORRECT Payment Interface (Fully Updated):
interface Payment {
  id: string;                           // ✅ Primary key
  deal_id: string;                      // ✅ Foreign key
  payment_sequence: number | null;      // ✅ NOT payment_number
  payment_amount: number | null;
  payment_date_estimated: string | null; // ✅ NOT payment_date
  payment_date_actual: string | null;
  payment_received_date: string | null;
  payment_received: boolean | null;     // ✅ NOT status string
  qb_invoice_id: string | null;
  qb_payment_id: string | null;
  payment_invoice_date: string | null;
  invoice_sent: boolean | null;
  agci: number | null;
  notes: string | null;
  created_at?: string;
  updated_at?: string;
}
```

### Key Database Relationships
```sql
-- Payment System Flow:
deal → commission_split (templates)
deal → payment (generated records)  
payment → payment_split (individual broker amounts per payment)

-- Property Information Access:
payment → deal → property (via JOINs)
```

## 🚨 CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES - UPDATED WITH SUCCESS PATTERNS

### Never Repeat These Mistakes ⚠️
1. **Never rewrite working components** - only replace specific calculation logic ✅ FOLLOWED SUCCESSFULLY
2. **Never assume field names** - always reference database schema ✅ LEARNED AND APPLIED
3. **Never change multiple things at once** - micro-iterations only ✅ APPLIED SUCCESSFULLY
4. **Never ignore TypeScript errors** - fix immediately or revert ✅ APPLIED SUCCESSFULLY
5. **Never guess component interfaces** - check existing working code ✅ FOLLOWED SUCCESSFULLY
6. **Never create new implementations when minimal edits work** ✅ LEARNED AND APPLIED
7. **Always verify database field mapping** - primary keys vs foreign keys ✅ CRITICAL LESSON APPLIED
8. **Always align TypeScript interfaces with database schema** ✅ NEW RULE SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED

### Database Field Mapping Lessons ✅ CRITICAL LEARNING APPLIED
**Today's Discovery**: TypeScript interface misalignment was causing all field mapping errors
- **Payment table**: Primary key is `id` (not `payment_id`) ✅ CORRECTED
- **PaymentSplit table**: Foreign key is `payment_id` (references payment.id) ✅ CORRECTED
- **TypeScript interface**: Must match exact database field names ✅ VERIFIED AND UPDATED
- **Field naming**: Database uses descriptive names like `payment_sequence`, `payment_received` ✅ ALL UPDATED

### Mandatory Process for Database Changes 📋
**Anytime we change database schema:**
1. 📄 **Download schema**: `supabase gen types typescript --project-id rqbvcvwbziilnycqtmnc > database-schema.ts`
2. 📤 **Upload to GitHub**: Commit to version control
3. 📋 **Upload to Claude**: Add to conversation for reference
4. **✅ APPLIED**: Verify TypeScript interfaces match database schema exactly

### Development Rules 🎯 - PROVEN SUCCESSFUL
- **One change per phase** - test immediately after each change ✅ USED SUCCESSFULLY
- **Revert if broken** - never debug broken states, go back to working version ✅ AVOIDED SUCCESSFULLY
- **Keep working patterns** - preserve existing imports, exports, component structure ✅ USED SUCCESSFULLY
- **Schema first** - check database schema before writing any database code ✅ CRITICAL AND APPLIED
- **Interface alignment** - ensure TypeScript interfaces match database exactly ✅ SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED
- **User is non-technical** - provide step-by-step instructions, minimize TypeScript battles ✅ USED SUCCESSFULLY
- **Minimal edits over rewrites** - when possible, provide specific line changes ✅ APPLIED SUCCESSFULLY
- **Modular architecture** - extract complex logic into reusable hooks ✅ MAINTAINED SUCCESSFULLY
