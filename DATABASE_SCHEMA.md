# Database Schema Documentation

## Recent Schema Changes - Payment Disbursement System

### Payment Table Updates

```sql
-- Added disbursement tracking to payment table
ALTER TABLE payment ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS referral_fee_paid BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
```

**New Field:**
- `referral_fee_paid` (BOOLEAN): Tracks whether the referral fee for this payment has been disbursed

### Payment Split Table Updates

```sql
-- Added disbursement tracking to payment_split table  
ALTER TABLE payment_split ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS paid BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
```

**New Field:**
- `paid` (BOOLEAN): Tracks whether the broker commission for this split has been disbursed

### Type Definitions

#### Payment Interface Updates
```typescript
export interface Payment {
  // ... existing fields ...
  
  // Disbursement tracking
  referral_fee_paid?: boolean | null;
}
```

#### PaymentSplit Interface Updates
```typescript
export interface PaymentSplit {
  // ... existing fields ...
  
  // Disbursement tracking
  paid?: boolean | null;
}
```

## Disbursement Logic

### Referral Fee Calculation
Referral fees are calculated proportionally based on the payment amount versus the total deal amount:

```
proportionalReferralFee = dealReferralFee Ã— (paymentAmount / totalDealAmount)
```

### Database Operations

#### Update Referral Payment Status
```sql
UPDATE payment 
SET referral_fee_paid = $1 
WHERE id = $2;
```

#### Update Payment Split Status
```sql
UPDATE payment_split 
SET paid = $1 
WHERE id = $2;
```

## Migration Notes

The migration script (`_master_migration_script.sql`) has been updated to include these new fields. When deploying:

1. Run the migration script to add the new columns
2. Existing records will have default values (FALSE for both fields)
3. The application will handle the new fields gracefully with null checks

## Data Flow

1. **Payment Received**: When `payment_received` is marked true on a payment
2. **Disbursement Generation**: System calculates all required disbursements:
   - Referral fee (if applicable, calculated proportionally)
   - Broker commissions (from payment splits with `split_broker_total > 0`)
3. **Status Tracking**: Each disbursement can be individually marked as paid
4. **Database Updates**: Status changes are persisted immediately to respective tables
