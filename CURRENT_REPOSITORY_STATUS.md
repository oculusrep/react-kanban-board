## Recent Changes Summary

### Latest Fix (2025-09-23)
**Problem**: Adding associations to notes was causing the entire page to refresh
**Solution**:
- Modified `NoteAssociations.tsx` to update local state instead of triggering full page reload
- Updated `NotesDebugPage.tsx` to handle association changes optimistically
- Fixed TypeScript errors related to null/undefined types

### Key Components
- **NoteAssociations.tsx**: New component that allows adding/removing note associations without page refresh
- **EntityAutocomplete.tsx**: Reusable autocomplete component for selecting entities (clients, deals, contacts, etc.)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Commit the cleanup**: The deleted temporary files should be committed to clean up the repository
2. **Review and commit new components**: The new sidebar and association components are substantial additions
3. **Keep main migration script**: `_master_migration_script.sql` should be preserved as it's the main database migration

### Files to Review Before Committing
- `PRODUCTION_CUTOVER_NOTES_GUIDE.md` - Review production deployment documentation
- New component files - Ensure they follow project conventions
- Modified page files - Verify changes are appropriate for production

### Security Note
âœ… **Cleanup Complete**: All temporary files containing Salesforce credentials and database keys have been removed from the repository.

3. Commit the changes in logical groups
4. Consider creating separate commits for:
