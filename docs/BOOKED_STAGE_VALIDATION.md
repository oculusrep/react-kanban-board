# Booked Stage Validation Feature

## Overview

This feature implements comprehensive validation and tracking for deals moving to the "Booked" stage, matching the same patterns used for "Lost" and "Closed Paid" stages.

## Features

### 1. Booked Date Validation

When a deal is moved to the "Booked" stage (either via Kanban drag-and-drop or Deal Details page save), the system validates that a `booked_date` is present.

**Validation Flow:**
- User attempts to move deal to "Booked" stage
- System checks if `booked_date` exists
- If missing, a modal popup appears requiring date entry
- User must enter a date or cancel the operation
- Once saved, the deal moves to Booked stage and appears at the top of the column

**Modal Message:**
> "Please enter a Booked Date in order to move this deal to the BOOKED stage"

### 2. Auto-Check Booked Checkbox

When a deal is moved to the "Booked" stage, the `booked` checkbox is automatically set to `true`.

This happens in two scenarios:
1. **Via Modal**: When saving a booked_date through the validation modal
2. **Via Form**: When changing stage to "Booked" and saving on Deal Details page (if booked_date already exists)

### 3. Kanban Auto-Positioning

Newly booked deals automatically appear at the **top** of the Booked column (position 0) when first moved to that stage.

**Behavior:**
- First time moving to Booked → Appears at top
- Manual reordering → Allowed after initial positioning
- Subsequent moves → Can be placed anywhere via drag-and-drop

### 4. Editable Fields on Deal Details Page

Both fields are visible and editable in the **Timeline** section:

**Booked Date:**
- DateInput field
- Fully editable at any time
- No stage restrictions

**Booked Checkbox:**
- Boolean checkbox
- Fully editable at any time
- Can be manually checked/unchecked

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema

The following fields exist in the `deal` table:

```sql

### Code Examples

**Validation Check (KanbanBoard.tsx):**
```typescript
// If moving to "Booked" stage, check if booked_date exists
if (destStageLabel === "Booked") {
  const { data: dealData, error } = await supabase
    .from("deal")
    .select("booked_date, deal_name")
    .eq("id", draggableId)
    .single();

  if (!dealData.booked_date) {
    setPendingDragResult(result);
    setCurrentBookedDate(dealData.booked_date);
    setDealNameForModal(dealData.deal_name || 'this deal');
    setShowBookedDateModal(true);
    return; // Don't proceed until date is provided
  }
}
```

**Auto-Check Booked (DealDetailsForm.tsx):**
```typescript
const isMovingToBooked = stageLabel === "Booked" && stageChanged;

const dealPayload = {
  // ... other fields
  booked_date: form.booked_date,
  booked: isMovingToBooked ? true : form.booked, // Auto-check when moving to Booked
  // ... other fields
};
```

**Auto-Positioning (KanbanBoard.tsx):**
```typescript
const isMovingToBooked = destStage?.label === "Booked" && stageChanged;
const insertIndex = (isMovingToLost || isMovingToClosedPaid || isMovingToBooked) ? 0 : destination.index;
cardsInDest.splice(insertIndex, 0, draggedCard);
```

## User Experience

### Kanban Board Flow

1. User drags deal card to "Booked" column
2. If `booked_date` is missing → Modal appears
3. User enters date (defaults to today) → Clicks "Save"
4. Deal updates with booked_date and booked=true
5. Deal appears at top of Booked column
6. Toast notification: "Deal marked as Booked"

### Deal Details Page Flow

1. User changes Stage dropdown to "Booked"
2. User clicks "Save Deal" button
3. If `booked_date` is missing → Modal appears
4. User enters date → Clicks "Save"
5. Deal saves with booked_date and booked=true
6. Returns to normal save flow

### Manual Editing

Users can edit both fields at any time:
- Navigate to Deal Details page
- Scroll to Timeline section
- Edit "Booked Date" field or check/uncheck "Booked" checkbox
- Click "Save Deal"

## Testing

### Test Scenarios

1. **Kanban Drag Without Date**
   - Drag deal to Booked → Modal appears
   - Cancel → Deal stays in original column
   - Save with date → Deal moves to Booked at top

2. **Kanban Drag With Date**
   - Deal already has booked_date
   - Drag to Booked → No modal, moves immediately
   - Appears at top of column

3. **Deal Details Save Without Date**
   - Change stage to "Booked"
   - Click Save → Modal appears
   - Enter date → Save succeeds

4. **Deal Details Save With Date**
   - Deal already has booked_date
   - Change stage to "Booked"
   - Click Save → No modal, saves immediately

5. **Manual Field Editing**
   - Edit booked_date in Timeline section
   - Check/uncheck booked checkbox
   - Both save correctly

6. **Auto-Positioning**
   - Move deal to Booked → Appears at top
   - Manually drag to different position → Stays there
