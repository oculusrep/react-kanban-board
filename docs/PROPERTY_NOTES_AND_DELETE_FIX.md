# Property Notes Field & Delete Functionality Fix - October 10, 2025

## Overview
Added `property_notes` field to the property slideout on the map and fixed property deletion to work with CASCADE DELETE constraints.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Property Notes Field ‚úÖ
**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/mapping/slideouts/PinDetailsSlideout.tsx`
- `src/components/mapping/layers/PropertyLayer.tsx`
- `src/hooks/useProperty.ts`

**What was added:**
- Editable `property_notes` textarea field in the Property tab of the slideout
- Positioned after City/State/ZIP fields, before financial fields
- 3-row textarea with placeholder text
- Auto-saves when clicking "UPDATE PROPERTY" button
- Integrated with existing `handlePropertyFieldUpdate` pattern

**Critical Bug Fixed:**
The PropertyLayer had TWO separate database queries for fetching properties:
1. **Regular query** (lines 88-116) - for limited results
2. **Paginated query** (lines 140-167) - for "fetch all" mode

The `property_notes` field was only in the first query, causing notes to appear as `undefined` when properties were loaded via pagination.

**Solution:**
Added `property_notes` (and other missing fields) to BOTH queries:
- `property_notes`
- `asking_purchase_price`
- `asking_lease_price`
- `lease_expiration_date`

### 2. Property Delete Functionality ‚úÖ
**Problem Diagnosed:**
Property deletion was working in code but failing with **HTTP 409 Conflict** errors due to foreign key constraints. The database was correctly preventing deletion of properties that had related records (site_submits, contacts, units, etc.), but the error message wasn't helpful.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/MappingPageNew.tsx`

**What was fixed:**
- Added proper error detection for foreign key constraint violations (HTTP 409, code 23503)
- Displays user-friendly message: "Cannot delete property: It has related records (site submits, contacts, or units). Please delete those first or contact support."
- Gives users actionable information instead of generic error

### 3. CASCADE DELETE Migration ‚úÖ
**File Created:**
- `migrations/add_cascade_delete_to_property_fkeys.sql`

**What it does:**
Enables automatic deletion of related records when a property is deleted by adding `ON DELETE CASCADE` to foreign key constraints in:
- `site_submit`
- `property_unit`
- `property_contact`
- `activity`
- `note_object_link`

**How to run:** (One-time only)
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `migrations/add_cascade_delete_to_property_fkeys.sql`
3. Run the query

**Status:** ‚úÖ Tested and confirmed working in production

## Technical Details

### Property Notes Data Flow
```
User types in textarea
  ‚Üì
handlePropertyFieldUpdate() updates local state
  ‚Üì
User clicks "UPDATE PROPERTY"
  ‚Üì
handleSavePropertyChanges() calls updateProperty()
  ‚Üì
useProperty hook sends to Supabase
  ‚Üì
Database updates property.property_notes
  ‚Üì
PropertyLayer refreshes with new query fetching property_notes
  ‚Üì
Notes persist when property is reopened
```

### Delete Workflow (After CASCADE migration)
```
User right-clicks property ‚Üí Delete Property
  ‚Üì
Confirmation dialog appears
  ‚Üì
User confirms
  ‚Üì
DELETE query sent to Supabase
  ‚Üì
Database CASCADE deletes all related records automatically:
  - site_submits
  - property_units
  - property_contacts
  - activities
  - note_object_links
  ‚Üì
Property and all related data deleted
  ‚Üì
Map refreshes, property removed
```

## Debugging Journey

### Property Notes Issue
**Symptom:** Notes would save successfully but disappear when reopening the property.

**Root Cause:** PropertyLayer's paginated query (used for "static-all" mode) was missing the `property_notes` field in its SELECT statement, causing it to return `undefined`.

**Proof:**
```javascript
// Console log showed:
üîç Property data received: {
  id: '8f117671-87cc-4bf2-a0dc-26755c376876',
  property_name: 'test',
  property_notes: undefined,  // ‚ùå Field was undefined
  hasPropertyNotes: false
}
```

**Fix:** Added `property_notes` to the paginated query's SELECT statement (line 149).

### Delete Issue
**Symptom:** Delete button appeared to do nothing in production.

**Root Cause:** HTTP 409 Conflict error from database due to foreign key constraints, but error was not being displayed helpfully to users.

**Proof:**
```javascript
// Console log showed:
‚ùå Error deleting property: Object
// HTTP 409 Conflict from rqbvcvwbziilnycqtmnc.supabase.co
```

**Fix:**
1. Added CASCADE DELETE migration to handle related records automatically
2. Improved error messaging to explain the constraint to users

## Commits
- `9b00105` - Add property_notes field to property slideout on map
- `7275546` - Improve property delete error messaging for foreign key constraints
- `3296ffb` - Add CASCADE DELETE migration for property foreign keys

## Testing Performed
1. ‚úÖ Added notes to a property ‚Üí saved ‚Üí closed slideout ‚Üí reopened ‚Üí notes persisted
2. ‚úÖ Deleted property without related records ‚Üí succeeded
3. ‚úÖ Deleted property with related records (before CASCADE) ‚Üí helpful error message
4. ‚úÖ Ran CASCADE migration in production
5. ‚úÖ Deleted property with related records (after CASCADE) ‚Üí all data deleted successfully

## Future Considerations

### Property Notes Enhancements
- Consider adding rich text formatting (bold, italic, lists)
- Add timestamps for when notes were last updated
- Add note history/audit trail
- Add character count indicator

### Delete Functionality
- Add "Delete with related records" confirmation that lists what will be deleted
- Add soft delete option (mark as deleted instead of hard delete)
- Add restore functionality for accidentally deleted properties

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always check ALL database queries:** When adding a new field, search for ALL places where that table is queried, not just the obvious one.

2. **Pagination queries are easy to miss:** PropertyLayer had two separate queries - one for limited results and one for paginated "fetch all". Both needed the same fields.

3. **Database constraints are helpful, not annoying:** The 409 error was PostgreSQL correctly protecting data integrity. The solution was to embrace CASCADE DELETE, not fight the constraints.

4. **Error messages matter:** The delete "wasn't working" but it was actually working correctly - users just didn't understand why it was being blocked. Better error messages solved the UX problem.

5. **Test in production:** The pagination query issue only appeared in production because dev was using a different loading mode. Always test both environments.
