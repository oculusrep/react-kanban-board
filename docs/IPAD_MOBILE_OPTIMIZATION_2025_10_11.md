# iPad/Mobile Map Optimization - October 11, 2025

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive touch/long-press support for the mapping page to enable full functionality on iPad and mobile devices. This included context menu support via long-press gestures and viewport fixes to prevent layout issues.

---

## Problem Statement

The mapping page was designed for desktop with right-click context menus, which don't work on touch devices like iPad. Additionally, the viewport would shrink on iPad with white/gray bars appearing on the side due to content overflow.

### Issues Addressed:
1. ❌ **No context menus on touch devices** - Right-click doesn't exist on iPad/mobile
2. ❌ **Cannot create properties on map** - No way to trigger "Create Property Here" menu
3. ❌ **Cannot access marker actions** - No way to verify location, delete, or create site submits
4. ❌ **Viewport shrinking** - Page would shrink with white bars on the side
5. ❌ **Horizontal scrolling** - Context menus positioned outside viewport caused page expansion

---

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Long-Press Detection System

Created a dual approach for detecting long-press gestures:

#### A. DOM-Based Long-Press Utility (`deviceDetection.ts`)
```typescript
export const addLongPressListener = (
  element: HTMLElement,
  onLongPress: (x: number, y: number) => void,
  duration: number = 500
): (() => void) => {
  // Tracks touch start time and position
  // Cancels if user moves >10px (prevents accidental triggers during scrolling)
  // Fires callback after 500ms if no movement
  // Returns cleanup function for proper memory management
}
```

**Features:**
- 500ms duration threshold (comfortable for users)
- 10px movement threshold (prevents accidental triggers)
- Cleanup function for memory management
- Works on any DOM element

#### B. Google Maps Event-Based Detection
For map and markers, we use Google Maps' native event system:

```typescript
map.addListener('mousedown', (event: google.maps.MapMouseEvent) => {
  // Touch events in Google Maps appear as MouseEvents
  if (event.domEvent instanceof TouchEvent) {
    touchStartTime = Date.now();
    touchLatLng = event.latLng;
  }
});

map.addListener('mouseup', (event: google.maps.MapMouseEvent) => {
  const touchDuration = Date.now() - touchStartTime;
  if (touchDuration >= 500 && !touchMoved) {
    // Trigger context menu
  }
});
```

**Why This Approach:**
- Standard Google Maps markers don't have `.getElement()` method
- Only Advanced Markers support direct DOM access
- Google Maps events work reliably across desktop and mobile
- Captures `latLng` directly from the event (no pixel conversion needed)

---

### 2. Implementation Details

#### Map Long-Press (MappingPageNew.tsx)
**Location:** `src/pages/MappingPageNew.tsx` in `handleMapLoad()` function

```typescript
// Add long-press listener for touch devices (iPad, mobile)
if (isTouchDevice()) {
  let touchStartTime = 0;
  let touchMoved = false;
  let touchStartPos = { x: 0, y: 0 };
  let touchLatLng: google.maps.LatLng | null = null;

  map.addListener('mousedown', (event: google.maps.MapMouseEvent) => {
    if (event.domEvent && event.domEvent instanceof TouchEvent && event.latLng) {
      touchStartTime = Date.now();
      touchMoved = false;
      touchLatLng = event.latLng;
      const touch = event.domEvent.touches[0];
      touchStartPos = { x: touch.clientX, y: touch.clientY };
    }
  });

  map.addListener('mousemove', (event: google.maps.MapMouseEvent) => {
    if (touchStartTime && event.domEvent && event.domEvent instanceof TouchEvent) {
      const touch = event.domEvent.touches[0];
      const deltaX = Math.abs(touch.clientX - touchStartPos.x);
      const deltaY = Math.abs(touch.clientY - touchStartPos.y);
      if (deltaX > 10 || deltaY > 10) {
        touchMoved = true;
      }
    }
  });

  map.addListener('mouseup', (event: google.maps.MapMouseEvent) => {
    if (touchStartTime && event.domEvent && event.domEvent instanceof TouchEvent && touchLatLng) {
      const touchDuration = Date.now() - touchStartTime;
      if (touchDuration >= 500 && !touchMoved) {
        // Show context menu
        setContextMenu({
          isVisible: true,
          x: touch.clientX,
          y: touch.clientY,
          coordinates: { lat: touchLatLng.lat(), lng: touchLatLng.lng() },
        });

        // Re-open after delay to ensure it stays visible
        setTimeout(() => {
          setContextMenu(prev => ({...prev, isVisible: true}));
        }, 100);
      }
    }
  });
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Captures `latLng` at `mousedown` (more reliable than pixel conversion)
- 10px movement threshold prevents accidental triggers while panning
- Re-opens menu after 100ms to combat click handler closing it
- Suppresses map context menu when marker was long-pressed

---

#### Property Marker Long-Press (PropertyLayer.tsx)
**Location:** `src/components/mapping/layers/PropertyLayer.tsx`

**Architecture Pattern:**
```typescript
// Long-press state for touch devices (defined here so click handler can access it)
let wasLongPress = false;

marker.addListener('click', () => {
  // Don't open slideout if this was a long-press
  if (wasLongPress) {
    console.log('🚫 Skipping click - was long press');
    wasLongPress = false;
    return;
  }
  // Normal click behavior - open slideout
});

// Add right-click listener for desktop
marker.addListener('rightclick', (event) => {
  onPropertyRightClick(property, event.domEvent.clientX, event.domEvent.clientY);
});

// Add long-press support for touch devices
if (isTouchDevice()) {
  marker.addListener('mousedown', (event) => { /* start timer */ });
  marker.addListener('mousemove', (event) => { /* track movement */ });
  marker.addListener('mouseup', (event) => {
    if (touchDuration >= 500 && !touchMoved) {
      wasLongPress = true;
      onPropertyRightClick(property, touch.clientX, touch.clientY);
    }
  });
}
```

**Critical Pattern:** The `wasLongPress` variable is defined BEFORE the click listener so both handlers can access it. This prevents the click handler from opening the slideout after a long-press.

**Applied to:**
- Session markers (newly created properties with red pins)
- Regular property markers (green pins)

---

#### Site Submit Marker Long-Press (SiteSubmitLayer.tsx)
**Location:** `src/components/mapping/layers/SiteSubmitLayer.tsx`

Same pattern as PropertyLayer with identical long-press detection logic.

---

### 3. Context Menu Persistence Challenge

**The Problem:**
When user lifts finger after long-press, this event sequence occurred:
1. `mouseup` fires → Opens context menu
2. `click` fires immediately → Marker's click handler runs
3. Map's `click` handler fires → Closes ALL context menus
4. **Result:** Menu flashes and disappears

**The Solution: Multi-Layer Defense**

#### Layer 1: Prevent Marker Click Handler
```typescript
let wasLongPress = false;

marker.addListener('click', () => {
  if (wasLongPress) {
    console.log('🚫 Skipping click - was long press');
    wasLongPress = false;
    return; // Exit early - don't open slideout
  }
  // Normal click opens slideout
});
```

#### Layer 2: Suppress Map Context Menu for Marker Long-Press
```typescript
const handlePropertyRightClick = (property: any, x: number, y: number) => {
  // Close the map context menu if it's open
  setContextMenu(prev => ({ ...prev, isVisible: false }));

  // Set flag to suppress map context menu
  setSuppressMapContextMenu(true);
  setTimeout(() => setSuppressMapContextMenu(false), 200);

  // Open property context menu
  setPropertyContextMenu({ isVisible: true, x, y, property });
};
```

#### Layer 3: Re-Open Menu After Map Click
```typescript
// Open context menu first
setPropertyContextMenu({ isVisible: true, x, y, property });

// Re-open after 100ms to ensure it stays visible
setTimeout(() => {
  setPropertyContextMenu(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    isVisible: true,
    x, y, property,
  }));
}, 100);
```

**Why This Works:**
- Click handler on marker returns early (Layer 1)
- Map context menu is suppressed (Layer 2)
- Even if map's click handler closes it, timeout re-opens it (Layer 3)

---

### 4. Viewport Shrinking Fix

**Problem:** Context menus positioned outside viewport caused page to expand horizontally, creating white bars on the side and shrinking the map.

#### Fix 1: Viewport Meta Tag
**File:** `index.html`

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no" />
```

**Changes:**
- Added `maximum-scale=1.0` - Prevents zoom/scale issues
- Added `user-scalable=no` - Prevents accidental pinch-zoom causing layout shifts

#### Fix 2: Overflow Prevention CSS
**File:** `index.html` (inline styles)

```css
/* Prevent horizontal scrolling and viewport issues on mobile */
html, body {
  overflow-x: hidden;
  width: 100%;
  position: relative;
}

/* Ensure root container doesn't overflow */
#root {
  overflow-x: hidden;
  width: 100%;
}
```

**Effect:**
- Forces all content to stay within 100% viewport width
- Prevents horizontal scrolling entirely
- Maintains proper stacking context with `position: relative`

#### Fix 3: Context Menu Position Constraints
**Files:** All context menu components
- `src/components/mapping/MapContextMenu.tsx`
- `src/components/mapping/PropertyContextMenu.tsx`
- `src/components/mapping/SiteSubmitContextMenu.tsx`

```typescript
// Constrain menu position to viewport to prevent horizontal scrolling
const menuWidth = 200;
const menuHeight = 200; // approximate
const constrainedX = Math.min(x, window.innerWidth - menuWidth - 10);
const constrainedY = Math.min(y, window.innerHeight - menuHeight - 10);

// Apply with minimum 10px padding from edges
style={{
  left: `${Math.max(10, constrainedX)}px`,
  top: `${Math.max(10, constrainedY)}px`,
}}
```

**Logic:**
1. Calculate maximum X position: `window.innerWidth - menuWidth - 10`
2. Use smaller of actual touch X or maximum X
3. Ensure at least 10px from left edge with `Math.max(10, constrainedX)`
4. Same logic for Y axis to prevent bottom overflow

**Result:** Context menus ALWAYS stay within viewport boundaries

## User Experience

### Desktop Behavior (Unchanged):
- Right-click on map → Context menu appears
- Right-click on marker → Context menu appears
- Click marker → Slideout opens

### iPad/Mobile Behavior (New):
- **Long-press empty map area (500ms)** → "Create Property Here" context menu
- **Long-press property marker (500ms)** → Property context menu (Verify Location, Delete, Create Site Submit)
- **Long-press site submit marker (500ms)** → Site submit context menu (Verify Location, Reset Location)
- **Quick tap marker** → Opens slideout (normal click behavior)
- **Drag map** → Pans map (movement >10px cancels long-press)
- **Context menus stay within viewport** → No page shrinking or horizontal scroll

---

## Technical Decisions & Rationale

### Why Not Use Native Touch Events?
**Attempted:** Direct `touchstart`, `touchmove`, `touchend` listeners on map div
**Problem:** Google Maps overlays intercept touch events, making them unreliable
**Solution:** Use Google Maps' event system which properly handles touch events as MouseEvents

### Why 500ms Duration?
- **Too short (<400ms):** Users accidentally trigger while trying to tap
- **Too long (>700ms):** Feels unresponsive and confusing
- **500ms:** Industry standard, familiar to users (iOS, Android)

### Why 10px Movement Threshold?
- Prevents accidental triggers during normal map panning
- Small enough that deliberate long-press works reliably
- Accounts for natural finger micro-movements

### Why Re-Open Menu After 100ms?
- Google Maps' click event fires synchronously after mouseup
- React state updates are batched and asynchronous
- 100ms window ensures menu opens → map click closes → timeout re-opens
- User doesn't perceive the flash (too fast)

### Why Not Use `event.stopPropagation()`?
**Attempted:** Preventing event propagation to map
**Problem:** Google Maps has its own event system separate from DOM
- `event.stopPropagation()` only stops DOM event bubbling
- Google Maps events fire independently
- Can't reliably prevent map's click handler from executing

**Solution:** Flag-based suppression + re-open pattern is more reliable

## Testing Checklist

### Map Long-Press:
- [ ] Long-press on empty map area → Context menu appears
- [ ] Context menu stays visible after lifting finger
- [ ] Menu shows "Create Property Here" option
- [ ] Menu positioned within viewport (no white bars)
- [ ] Dragging map >10px cancels long-press
- [ ] Creating property successfully opens modal

### Property Marker Long-Press:
- [ ] Long-press on green property marker → Property menu appears
- [ ] Long-press on red session marker → Property menu appears
- [ ] Menu shows: Verify Location, Delete, Create Site Submit
- [ ] Menu stays visible after lifting finger
- [ ] Quick tap opens property slideout (not context menu)

### Site Submit Marker Long-Press:
- [ ] Long-press on colored site submit marker → Site submit menu appears
- [ ] Menu shows: Verify Location, Reset Location
- [ ] Menu stays visible after lifting finger
- [ ] Quick tap opens site submit slideout (not context menu)

### Viewport Stability:
- [ ] Long-press near right edge → Menu shifts left to stay on screen
- [ ] Long-press near bottom → Menu shifts up to stay on screen
- [ ] Long-press in corner → Menu positions to stay fully visible
- [ ] No white/gray bars appear on sides
- [ ] Page width stays at 100% (no horizontal scroll)
- [ ] Creating properties doesn't cause viewport shrink

### Cross-Browser:
- [ ] Works in Safari on iPad
- [ ] Works in Chrome on iPad
- [ ] Works on iPhone (smaller viewport)
- [ ] Desktop right-click still works (unchanged)

---

## Known Limitations

### 1. Cannot Disable Long-Press for Text Selection
The viewport meta tag `user-scalable=no` also disables text selection on iOS. This is acceptable for a map-focused interface but worth noting.

### 2. Long-Press on Clustered Markers
When markers are clustered, long-press may:
- Trigger on the cluster (shows cluster properties)
- Need to zoom in to access individual marker long-press
- This is expected behavior consistent with desktop click

### 3. Simultaneous Touches
The implementation assumes single-touch interaction. Multi-touch gestures (pinch-zoom on map) work normally but aren't detected as long-press.

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Haptic Feedback:** Add vibration on successful long-press detection
2. **Visual Indicator:** Show expanding circle during long-press to indicate detection
3. **Configurable Duration:** Allow users to adjust long-press duration in settings
4. **Touch Event Analytics:** Track long-press usage vs tap usage
5. **Gesture Training:** First-time user tutorial for long-press functionality

### Not Recommended:
- ❌ Shorter duration (<500ms) - Too many accidental triggers
- ❌ Larger movement threshold (>15px) - Makes deliberate long-press harder
- ❌ Native context menu CSS - Not supported consistently across mobile browsers

---

## Debugging Tips

### Context Menu Not Appearing:
1. Check Eruda console for touch event logs
2. Look for: "📱 Touch start on map at:", "📱 Long press detected"
3. Verify `isTouchDevice()` returns true on iPad

### Context Menu Disappearing Immediately:
1. Check for "🚫 Skipping click - was long press" log
2. Verify `wasLongPress` flag is being set
3. Check re-open setTimeout is executing (100ms delay)

### Viewport Still Shrinking:
1. Verify overflow-x: hidden is applied (check computed styles)
2. Check context menu position constraints
3. Look for any absolutely positioned elements outside viewport
4. Check if modals or slideouts are causing expansion

### Console Logs Added:
```
📱 Touch start on map at: [lat, lng]
📱 Long press on property marker: [property name]
📱 Long press on site submit marker: [site submit name]
📱 Long press detected on map at: [lat, lng]
🚫 Skipping click - was long press
🚫 Marker was long-pressed, skipping map context menu
🎯 Property right-clicked: [property id]
🎯 Site submit right-clicked: [site submit id]
```

---

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management:
- Long-press timers are properly cleared in `touchend`/`mouseup`
- No memory leaks from dangling timers
- Event listeners scoped to marker lifecycle

### Event Handler Efficiency:
- Movement detection only runs when touch is active
- Calculations (distance, duration) are minimal
- No DOM manipulation during touch tracking

### React State Updates:
- Context menu re-open uses functional update pattern
- Prevents unnecessary re-renders
- Batched state updates where possible

### How to Debug Mobile Issues in the Future

If you encounter mobile-specific issues in the future, here's how to debug them:

#### Option 1: Eruda Mobile Console (Quick & Easy)
Add this temporarily to `index.html` for on-device debugging:

```html
<!-- Mobile console for debugging on iPad/mobile -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/eruda"></script>
<script>eruda.init();</script>
```

**Features:**
- Floating console button appears in bottom-right
- Full JavaScript console with error messages
- Network tab to see failed requests
- Elements inspector
- Resources viewer

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Remove before committing to production!

#### Option 2: Safari Remote Debugging (Most Powerful)
For iPad debugging from a Mac:

1. **On iPad:**
   - Settings → Safari → Advanced → Enable "Web Inspector"

2. **On Mac:**
   - Connect iPad via USB or ensure same WiFi network
   - Open Safari → Develop → [Your iPad Name] → [Your Page]
   - Full DevTools with console, network, elements, etc.

**Advantages:**
- Full desktop DevTools experience
- Real-time DOM inspection
- Network waterfall
- Performance profiling

#### Option 3: Chrome Remote Debugging (Android)
For Android devices:

1. **On Android:**
   - Settings → Developer Options → Enable USB Debugging
   - Connect via USB

2. **On Computer:**
   - Chrome → `chrome://inspect`
   - Select your device
   - Full Chrome DevTools

#### Option 4: Codespaces Port Forwarding
For testing dev build on mobile without deploying:

1. **In Codespaces:**
   - PORTS tab → Find port 5173
   - Right-click → Port Visibility → Public

2. **On Mobile:**
   - Login to GitHub (if needed)
   - Open forwarded URL in browser
   - Hot reload works!

### Common Mobile Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: White/Gray Bars on Side (Viewport Shrinking)
**Cause:** Content positioned outside viewport
**Solution:**
- Check `overflow-x: hidden` on html/body
- Constrain absolute/fixed positioned elements
- Add viewport boundary checking to modals/menus

#### Issue: Touch Events Not Working
**Cause:** Desktop event handlers only
**Solution:**
- Use Google Maps event system (not direct DOM events)
- Check `event.domEvent instanceof TouchEvent`
- Add `isTouchDevice()` conditional logic

#### Issue: Long-Press Too Sensitive
**Cause:** Movement threshold too small
**Solution:**
- Increase movement threshold (default 10px)
- Add multi-touch detection for gestures
- Check `event.domEvent.touches.length`

#### Issue: Context Menu Disappears Immediately
**Cause:** Click handler firing after touch
**Solution:**
- Use flag-based suppression (`wasLongPress`)
- Add re-open timeout (100ms)
- Scope variables correctly for handler access

### Testing Checklist for Mobile Changes

Before deploying mobile-related changes:

- [ ] Test on Safari iPad (primary target)
- [ ] Test on Chrome iPad (secondary)
- [ ] Test on iPhone (smaller viewport)
- [ ] Test both portrait and landscape orientations
- [ ] Verify no horizontal scrolling
- [ ] Check console for errors (Eruda or Remote Debug)
- [ ] Test all touch gestures:
  - [ ] Single tap
  - [ ] Long-press (500ms)
  - [ ] Drag/pan
  - [ ] Pinch-to-zoom
  - [ ] Two-finger pan
- [ ] Verify viewport doesn't shrink
- [ ] Check context menus stay on screen
- [ ] Test with slow network (mobile data simulation)

### Environment Variables for Mobile Testing

Consider adding these to `.env` for easy toggling:

```env
# Enable mobile debugging console
VITE_ENABLE_MOBILE_DEBUG=false

# Log touch events to console
VITE_LOG_TOUCH_EVENTS=false

# Adjust long-press duration (ms)
VITE_LONG_PRESS_DURATION=500

# Movement threshold (px)
VITE_MOVEMENT_THRESHOLD=10
```

Then use in code:
```typescript
const DEBUG_MOBILE = import.meta.env.VITE_ENABLE_MOBILE_DEBUG === 'true';
const LONG_PRESS_DURATION = parseInt(import.meta.env.VITE_LONG_PRESS_DURATION || '500');
```

## Update: Slideout Scrolling Fix (January 18, 2025)

### Problem
On iPad, when scrolling within the property/site submit slideouts, the map behind the slideout would sometimes scroll instead of (or in addition to) the slideout content. Additionally, content at the bottom of the slideout was getting cut off, making it difficult to see buttons and the last few items.

### Issues Addressed:
1. ❌ **Scroll chaining** - Scrolling slideout would trigger map scroll
2. ❌ **Bottom content cutoff** - Last items and buttons were hidden off-screen
3. ❌ **Non-smooth scrolling** - iOS momentum scrolling wasn't working properly

### Solution

#### File Modified: `src/components/mapping/slideouts/PinDetailsSlideout.tsx`

**Changes to Main Slideout Container (lines 1819-1830):**
```typescript
<div
  className={`fixed top-0 h-full bg-white border-l border-gray-200 shadow-xl transition-all duration-300 z-40 flex flex-col ${
    !isOpen ? 'translate-x-full' : isMinimized ? 'w-12' : 'w-[500px]'
  } ${isMinimized ? 'overflow-hidden' : ''}`}
  style={{
    right: `${rightOffset}px`,
    top: '67px',
    height: 'calc(100vh - 67px - 20px)', // Added 20px bottom margin
    transform: !isOpen ? 'translateX(100%)' : 'translateX(0)',
    touchAction: 'pan-y', // Restrict touch to vertical panning only
    WebkitOverflowScrolling: 'touch' // Smooth iOS scrolling
  }}
>
```

**Key Changes:**
1. **Added `flex flex-col`** to className for proper flex layout
2. **Reduced height:** `calc(100vh - 67px - 20px)` to add 20px bottom margin
3. **Added `touchAction: 'pan-y'`** to restrict touch gestures to vertical panning
4. **Added `WebkitOverflowScrolling: 'touch'`** for smooth iOS scrolling
5. **Removed `overflow-y-auto`** from main container (moved to content area)

**Changes to Content Area (lines 2046-2054):**
```typescript
<div
  className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto px-4 py-3 pb-6"
  style={{
    scrollBehavior: 'smooth',
    minHeight: 0,
    touchAction: 'pan-y', // Prevent map scrolling when scrolling slideout
    WebkitOverflowScrolling: 'touch', // Smooth scrolling on iOS
    overscrollBehavior: 'contain' // Prevent scroll chaining to map
  }}
>
```

**Key Changes:**
1. **Added `pb-6`** (24px bottom padding) to prevent bottom cutoff
2. **Added `touchAction: 'pan-y'`** to content area for touch control
3. **Added `WebkitOverflowScrolling: 'touch'`** for momentum scrolling
4. **Added `overscrollBehavior: 'contain'`** to prevent scroll chaining

### How It Works

**Touch Action Control:**
- `touchAction: 'pan-y'` restricts touch gestures to vertical panning only
- Prevents horizontal swipes and diagonal gestures from affecting the map
- Touch events stay isolated to the slideout

**Overscroll Behavior:**
- `overscrollBehavior: 'contain'` prevents "scroll chaining"
- When user scrolls to the top/bottom of slideout, scrolling stops
- Map behind slideout won't start scrolling when slideout hits limits

**Smooth iOS Scrolling:**
- `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` enables native momentum scrolling
- Gives natural, smooth iOS feel when scrolling
- Improves overall scrolling performance

**Bottom Spacing:**
- 20px bottom margin on main container
- 24px bottom padding on content area
- Ensures all content and buttons are fully visible
- Provides comfortable spacing from screen edge

### User Experience Improvements

**Before:**
- ❌ Scrolling slideout sometimes scrolled map
- ❌ Bottom content cut off on screen edge
- ❌ Abrupt, non-smooth scrolling on iOS
- ❌ Difficult to access buttons at bottom

**After:**
- ✅ Slideout scrolling isolated from map
- ✅ Full content visible with proper spacing
- ✅ Smooth, native iOS momentum scrolling
- ✅ Easy access to all content and buttons
- ✅ No accidental map movement when using slideout

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Scroll slideout content - map stays still
- [ ] Reach bottom of slideout - all buttons visible
- [ ] Scroll past bottom - doesn't trigger map scroll
- [ ] Scroll past top - doesn't trigger map scroll
- [ ] Smooth momentum scrolling on iOS
- [ ] Content has adequate spacing from bottom
- [ ] Works in both portrait and landscape
- [ ] Multiple stacked slideouts (property + site submit) work correctly

### Technical Details

**CSS Properties Used:**
- `touch-action: pan-y` - Restricts touch to vertical panning
- `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` - iOS momentum scrolling
- `overscroll-behavior: contain` - Prevents scroll chaining
- `flex-col` - Proper flex layout for height calculations
- `calc(100vh - 67px - 20px)` - Dynamic height with bottom spacing

**Why This Approach:**
- Modern CSS properties designed for mobile touch
- No JavaScript event handling needed
- Better performance than JS scroll prevention
- Native browser behavior for smooth UX
- Works across all modern mobile browsers
