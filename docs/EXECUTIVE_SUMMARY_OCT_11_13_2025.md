## Technical Highlights

### Architecture Wins
```typescript
// Platform detection utility (reusable)
src/utils/deviceDetection.ts

// GPS tracking with cleanup
useEffect(() => {
  const watchId = navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(...);
  return () => clearWatch(watchId);
}, []);

// Many-to-many with history
contact <-> contact_client_role <-> client
                  ↓
                role (is_active flag)
```

### Code Quality
