# OVIS Deployment Session - October 6, 2025

## Overview

Successfully deployed the OVIS (Oculus Very Intelligent System) application to production on Vercel with custom domain configuration and full authentication.

**Production URL:** https://ovis.oculusrep.com
**Deployment Platform:** Vercel
**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Live

---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Vercel Deployment Setup

**Actions Taken:**
- Installed Vercel CLI: `npm install -g vercel`
- Authenticated with Vercel account
- Created new Vercel project named "ovis"
- Connected GitHub repository for auto-deployment
- Configured build settings:
  - Framework: Vite
  - Build Command: `vite build`
  - Output Directory: `dist`

**Deployment URL Created:**
- Initial: `https://ovis-iv8nhcnv9-mike-minihans-projects.vercel.app`
- Production: `https://ovis-badj7r68g-mike-minihans-projects.vercel.app`

---

### 2. Environment Variables Configuration

**Added 8 environment variables via Vercel CLI:**

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://rqbvcvwbziilnycqtmnc.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[anon_key]

# Google Maps Integration
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=[maps_key]
VITE_GOOGLE_GEOCODING_API_KEY=[geocoding_key]

# Dropbox Integration
VITE_DROPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=[access_token]
VITE_DROPBOX_REFRESH_TOKEN=[refresh_token]
VITE_DROPBOX_APP_KEY=[app_key]
VITE_DROPBOX_APP_SECRET=[app_secret]
```

**Method:** Used `vercel env add` for each variable, applied to Production, Preview, and Development environments.

---

### 3. Custom Domain Configuration

**Domain:** ovis.oculusrep.com
**Registrar:** GoDaddy
**DNS Provider:** Squarespace (via nameservers)

**Challenge:** Domain was using Squarespace nameservers, couldn't add DNS records in GoDaddy.

**Solution:**
- Added CNAME record in Squarespace DNS settings instead
- **Record Details:**
  - Type: CNAME
  - Host: ovis
  - Data: b24bb25eacb5c6bc.vercel-dns-017.com
  - TTL: 4 hours

**DNS Propagation Time:** ~5 minutes (faster than expected)

**SSL Certificate:** Auto-configured by Vercel

---

### 4. External Service Configuration

#### Supabase CORS and Authentication URLs

**Updated in Supabase Dashboard:**

1. **Authentication → URL Configuration:**
   - Site URL: `https://ovis.oculusrep.com`
   - Redirect URLs:
     - `https://ovis.oculusrep.com/**`
     - `https://ovis-badj7r68g-mike-minihans-projects.vercel.app/**`
     - `https://*.vercel.app/**`

**Important Note:** Site URL field does NOT accept wildcards, but Redirect URLs do.

#### Google Maps API Configuration

**Updated in Google Cloud Console:**

1. **APIs & Services → Credentials → API Key**
2. **Application restrictions → HTTP referrers:**
   - `https://ovis.oculusrep.com/*`
   - `https://ovis-badj7r68g-mike-minihans-projects.vercel.app/*`
   - `https://*.vercel.app/*`

**Note:** Only Maps JavaScript API needs referrer restrictions. Geocoding API works with key-only auth.

#### Dropbox OAuth Configuration

**Updated in Dropbox App Console:**

1. **OAuth 2 → Redirect URIs:**
   - `https://ovis.oculusrep.com`
   - `https://ovis-badj7r68g-mike-minihans-projects.vercel.app`

---

### 5. Authentication Implementation

#### Phase 1: Enable Login Screen

**File Modified:** `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Uncommented authentication logic that was disabled for testing
- Removed bypass that allowed unauthenticated access

**Code Change:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (auth disabled):
export default function ProtectedRoute({ children }: ProtectedRouteProps) {
  return <>{children}</>;
}

// AFTER (auth enabled):
export default function ProtectedRoute({ children }: ProtectedRouteProps) {
  const { user, loading } = useAuth();

  if (loading) {
    return <LoadingSpinner />;
  }

  if (!user) {
    return <LoginForm />;
  }

  return <>{children}</>;
}
```

**Result:** Unauthenticated users now see login screen instead of app.

#### Phase 2: Password Reset Flow

**Problem Identified:**
- User sent password recovery email but it just logged them in
- No password reset form appeared
- User couldn't set a password for regular login

**Files Created:**
1. `src/pages/ResetPasswordPage.tsx` - Password reset UI component
2. Updated `src/components/LoginForm.tsx` - Added "Forgot Password" functionality
3. Updated `src/App.tsx` - Added public route for `/reset-password`
4. Updated `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Added Outlet support for nested routes
5. Created `vercel.json` - Fixed client-side routing 404 issue

**Password Reset Flow:**
1. User clicks "Forgot password?" on login screen
2. Enters email address
3. Receives password reset email from Supabase
4. Clicks link → Redirects to `/reset-password` page
5. Enters new password (min 6 characters)
6. Confirms password
7. Updates password via Supabase API
8. Auto-redirects to app (logged in)

**Supabase Configuration:**
- Password reset emails now redirect to: `https://ovis.oculusrep.com/reset-password`
- Uses Supabase auth token in URL fragment

**Vercel Configuration Added:**
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Why Needed:** Vercel was returning 404 for `/reset-password` route because it tried to find a file instead of letting React Router handle it. This configuration tells Vercel to always serve `index.html` and let the client-side router handle routing.

---

### 6. User Account Setup

**Created Users in Supabase:**
- Email: mike@oculusrep.com
- Provider: Email (OAuth)
- Status: Confirmed
- Authentication Methods:
  - Magic Link (email-based login)
  - Password (after reset flow)

**Test Account:** test@oculusrep.com (deleted during session)

---

### 7. Backup System Documentation

**Created comprehensive backup guides:**

**Files Created:**
- `scripts/backup-database.sh` - Automated database backup script
- `scripts/restore-database.sh` - Database restoration script
- `docs/BACKUP_RECOVERY_GUIDE.md` - Complete backup/recovery documentation

**Backup Strategy:**
- **Code:** Automatically backed up via Git (GitHub + Vercel)
- **Database:** Manual backups required (Supabase free tier has no auto-backup)
- **Backup Location:** `backups/database/` (gitignored)
- **Backup Format:** PostgreSQL SQL dumps (gzipped)

**Recovery Times:**
- Undo local code changes: 10 seconds
- Rollback Vercel deployment: 30 seconds
- Restore database: 5-15 minutes
- Complete disaster recovery: 30-60 minutes

**Added to package.json:**
```json
"scripts": {
  "backup:db": "./scripts/backup-database.sh",
  "restore:db": "./scripts/restore-database.sh"
}
```

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: DNS Configuration with Squarespace Nameservers

**Problem:**
- Domain registered with GoDaddy
- Nameservers pointed to Squarespace
- GoDaddy DNS management was locked/greyed out

**Solution:**
- Added CNAME record in Squarespace DNS settings instead
- Preserved main site (oculusrep.com → Squarespace)
- Added subdomain (ovis.oculusrep.com → Vercel)

**Lesson:** When using third-party nameservers, always add DNS records at the nameserver provider, not the domain registrar.

---

### Challenge 2: Google Maps 404 Errors

**Problem:**
- Map loaded on localhost but not on production
- Console error: 404 (Not Found)

**Root Cause:**
- Google Maps API HTTP referrer restrictions didn't include Vercel domain
- API key was restricted to localhost only

**Solution:**
- Updated HTTP referrers in Google Cloud Console
- Added custom domain to whitelist
- **Important:** Must click SAVE button (was missed initially)

**Prevention:**
- Always update API restrictions when deploying to new domains
- Test on production URL before considering deployment complete

---

### Challenge 3: Supabase Site URL Wildcards

**Problem:**
- Tried to set Site URL to `https://ovis.oculusrep.com/**`
- Supabase rejected with "wildcards cannot be used here"

**Root Cause:**
- Site URL field requires exact domain (no wildcards)
- Redirect URLs field allows wildcards

**Solution:**
- Site URL: `https://ovis.oculusrep.com` (no wildcard)
- Redirect URLs: `https://ovis.oculusrep.com/**` (with wildcard)

**UI Quirk:** Supabase sometimes shows success message but doesn't visually update the field. Refresh page to verify.

---

### Challenge 4: Password Reset 404 Error

**Problem:**
- Password reset route `/reset-password` returned 404 on Vercel
- Worked fine on localhost

**Root Cause:**
- Vercel serves static files by default
- Tries to find `/reset-password.html` file
- React Router needs SPA-style routing

**Solution 1 (Initial Attempt - Failed):**
- Nested Routes structure with `path="/*"`
- Still caused 404 errors

**Solution 2 (Final - Success):**
- Created `vercel.json` with rewrite rules
- All requests route to `/index.html`
- React Router handles routing client-side

**Code:**
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

---

### Challenge 5: Nested Routes with ProtectedRoute

**Problem:**
- Initial routing structure used nested `<Routes>` components
- Caused conflicts with protected/public routes

**Solution:**
- Refactored to use `<Outlet />` component from React Router
- Public routes (like `/reset-password`) at top level
- Protected routes as nested children with shared layout

**Before:**
```tsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="/reset-password" element={<ResetPasswordPage />} />
  <Route path="/*" element={
    <ProtectedRoute>
      <Routes>
        {/* Nested routes - DOESN'T WORK */}
      </Routes>
    </ProtectedRoute>
  } />
</Routes>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="/reset-password" element={<ResetPasswordPage />} />
  <Route path="/" element={<ProtectedRoute><Layout /></ProtectedRoute>}>
    <Route index element={<Navigate to="/master-pipeline" />} />
    <Route path="master-pipeline" element={<KanbanBoard />} />
    {/* Other routes */}
  </Route>
</Routes>
```

2. Runs "Commit and Sync" in VS Code
3. Code pushed to GitHub
4. Vercel detects push (GitHub integration)
5. Vercel builds project (`vite build`)
6. Deployment goes live (~2-3 minutes)
7. Available at https://ovis.oculusrep.com

**Branch Previews:**
- Feature branches create preview URLs
- Format: `https://ovis-git-[branch-name].vercel.app`
- Useful for testing before merging to main

### Manual Deployment (If Needed)

```bash
# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Check deployment status

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Failed to fetch" errors

**Cause:** CORS not configured for new domain

**Solution:**
1. Add domain to Supabase allowed origins
2. Settings → API → Additional allowed origins
3. Add: `https://your-domain.com`

### Issue: Google Maps not loading

**Cause:** HTTP referrer restrictions blocking requests

**Solution:**
1. Google Cloud Console → Credentials
2. Edit API key → Application restrictions
3. Add domain: `https://your-domain.com/*`
4. **SAVE** (don't forget!)

### Issue: Dropbox upload/download fails

**Cause:** OAuth redirect URI not whitelisted

**Solution:**
1. Dropbox Developers → Your App
2. OAuth 2 → Redirect URIs
3. Add: `https://your-domain.com`

### Issue: Password reset link shows 404

**Cause:** `vercel.json` not configured or not deployed

**Solution:**
1. Verify `vercel.json` exists with rewrite rules
2. Commit and push: `git add vercel.json && git commit -m "Add vercel config" && git push`
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment

### Issue: Users can't log in after deployment

**Cause:** Authentication accidentally disabled or environment variables missing

**Solution:**
1. Check `ProtectedRoute.tsx` - auth code should be uncommented
2. Verify environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Check Supabase Site URL matches production domain
