# GPS Auto-Center Feature - October 12, 2025

## Overview
Enhanced GPS tracking with auto-centering capability and improved button stability. The map now automatically follows your location as you move, with a toggle to enable/disable this behavior.

---

## Key Features

### 1. **Stable GPS Toggle Button**
- Fixed disappearing button issue
- Uses stable refs to maintain event handlers
- Button remains visible and functional
- Located in bottom-left corner

### 2. **Auto-Center Feature**
- Map automatically pans to follow your location
- Enabled by default when GPS tracking starts
- Updates smoothly as you move
- Smart zoom adjustment for poor GPS accuracy

### 3. **Auto-Center Toggle**
- Second button appears when GPS tracking is active
- Click to toggle auto-centering on/off
- Visual indicator shows current state
- Automatically disables when you manually drag the map

---

## User Interface

### Two Buttons (Bottom-Left Corner)

#### Button 1: GPS Tracking Toggle
**Always Visible**
- **Inactive State:** Gray circle with dot
- **Active State:** Blue filled circle with white dot
- **Action:** Click to start/stop GPS tracking
- **Size:** 48x48px

#### Button 2: Auto-Center Toggle
**Visible Only When GPS Tracking is Active**
- **Active State:** Blue crosshair with center dot
- **Inactive State:** Gray crosshair with center dot
- **Action:** Click to toggle auto-centering
- **Size:** 48x48px

---

## How It Works

### Starting GPS Tracking

1. **Click GPS Button** (bottom-left, always visible)
   - Button turns blue
   - Browser prompts for location permission (first time)
   - Blue dot appears on map at your location
   - Auto-center button appears below GPS button
   - Map automatically centers on your location

2. **Auto-Center is ON by Default**
   - Map follows you as you move
   - Smooth panning animations
   - Blue crosshair button indicates "ON"

### Using Auto-Center

**To Disable Auto-Center:**
- **Option 1:** Click the auto-center button (turns gray)
- **Option 2:** Manually drag the map (auto-disables)

**To Re-Enable Auto-Center:**
- Click the auto-center button again (turns blue)
- Map will pan back to your current location
- Will continue following you as you move

### Stopping GPS Tracking

1. **Click GPS Button Again**
   - Button returns to gray
   - Blue dot disappears
   - Accuracy circle disappears
   - Auto-center button hides
   - GPS tracking stops (saves battery)

---

## Auto-Center Behavior

### When Auto-Center is ON:
- Map pans to your GPS location every time it updates
- Smooth animation (`panTo` instead of hard `setCenter`)
- If accuracy is poor (>100m), automatically zooms to level 15
- Updates respect the 10m distance filter

### When Auto-Center is OFF:
- You can freely pan/zoom the map
- Blue dot still updates in place
- GPS tracking continues in background
- Map doesn't move automatically

### Auto-Disabling:
Auto-center automatically turns OFF when:
- You manually drag the map
- You want to explore other areas while tracking

---

## Technical Implementation

### Button Stability Fix

**Problem:** Button disappeared after creation
**Solution:**
- Used `useRef` for stable function references
- Stored controls in map object for persistence
- Updated controls via effects, not recreating them

```typescript
// Stable ref for toggle function
const toggleTrackingRef = useRef(toggleTracking);
useEffect(() => {
  toggleTrackingRef.current = toggleTracking;
}, [toggleTracking]);

// Button click uses ref
gpsButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
  toggleTrackingRef.current();
});
```

### Auto-Center Implementation

```typescript
// Auto-center when position updates
useEffect(() => {
  if (autoCenterEnabled && isTracking && gpsPosition) {
    map.panTo({ lat: gpsPosition.lat, lng: gpsPosition.lng });

    // Smart zoom for poor accuracy
    if (gpsPosition.accuracy > 100 && map.getZoom() > 15) {
      map.setZoom(15);
    }
  }
}, [gpsPosition, autoCenterEnabled, isTracking]);
```

### Drag Detection

```typescript
// Disable auto-center when user drags map
map.addListener('dragstart', () => {
  if (isTracking && autoCenterEnabled) {
    console.log('🖐️ User dragged map - disabling auto-center');
    setAutoCenterEnabled(false);
  }
});
```

## Marker Visual Reference

### Your Initial Location (Static)
- **Shape:** Large purple pin
- **Size:** 40px
- **Purpose:** Shows where you were when map loaded
- **Stays in place:** Doesn't move

### Live GPS Location (Dynamic)
- **Shape:** Blue dot with white ring
- **Size:** 24px + accuracy circle
- **Purpose:** Shows your current location
- **Updates:** Moves as you move (10m threshold)

### Clear Visual Distinction
- Purple pin = Starting point (static)
- Blue dot = Current location (live)
- Easy to see how far you've moved!

---

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Walking Navigation
**Scenario:** Walking through a neighborhood to check properties

1. Open map → See large purple pin at starting location
2. Click GPS button → Blue dot appears, map centers
3. Start walking → Map follows you automatically
4. See property of interest → Drag map to explore (auto-center disables)
5. Want to continue following → Click auto-center button (re-enables)
6. Finish walking → Click GPS button to stop tracking

**Benefits:**
- Don't lose your place while walking
- See properties relative to your current position
- Easy to toggle between following and exploring

### Use Case 2: Driving Route
**Scenario:** Driving to visit multiple properties

1. Start GPS tracking before leaving
2. Map follows you as you drive
3. Approaching property → Map automatically shows you're near
4. Stop to view property details → Drag map to see info (auto-disables)
5. Continue driving → Click auto-center to resume following
6. End of day → Stop GPS tracking

**Benefits:**
- Real-time position awareness
- See upcoming properties
- Battery-efficient tracking

### Use Case 3: Stationary Planning
**Scenario:** In office, planning site visits

1. Open map → See initial location (office)
2. Don't need GPS tracking → Leave it off
3. Explore map freely without tracking

**Benefits:**
- No unnecessary GPS usage
- No battery drain
- No auto-centering interruptions

## Troubleshooting

### GPS Button Not Visible

1. **Check Console Logs**
   - Look for: "✅ GPS tracking controls added to map"
   - If missing, map may not have loaded

2. **Check in Eruda Console** (iPad)
   ```javascript
   document.querySelector('[data-gps-control]')
   ```
   - Should return the button element
   - If null, controls weren't created

3. **Verify Button is in DOM**
   ```javascript
   const controls = document.querySelectorAll('[data-gps-control]');
   console.log('GPS controls found:', controls.length);
   ```

### Auto-Center Not Working

1. **Check if GPS tracking is active**
   - GPS button should be blue
   - Blue dot should be visible on map

2. **Check auto-center state**
   - Auto-center button should be blue (ON)
   - Look for console log: "🎯 Auto-centering map on GPS location"

3. **Check if you manually dragged map**
   - Dragging auto-disables auto-center
   - Click auto-center button to re-enable

### Map Jumps/Jitters

**Cause:** GPS position updates too frequently
**Solution:** Increase distance filter in hook settings

```typescript
distanceFilter: 20  // Increase from 10 to 20 meters
```

---

## Performance

### Battery Usage
- **GPS Tracking:** ~30% of high-accuracy mode
- **Auto-Center:** Negligible (just map panning)
- **Combined:** Still battery-efficient

### Update Frequency
- Position updates: Every 10+ meters moved
- Auto-center panning: Matches position updates
- Smooth animations: No performance impact

---

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features:
1. **Heading Indicator** - Arrow showing direction of travel
2. **Trail/Breadcrumbs** - Show path traveled
3. **Speed-Based Zoom** - Auto-adjust zoom based on speed
4. **Compass Mode** - Rotate map based on heading
5. **Geofencing** - Alerts when entering/leaving areas

---

## Keyboard Shortcuts (Future)

Potential keyboard shortcuts:
- `G` - Toggle GPS tracking
- `C` - Toggle auto-center
- `Spacebar` - Re-center on current location

---

## Accessibility

### Screen Reader Support

- Clear tooltips on hover
- Descriptive titles for all controls

### Touch-Friendly
- 48x48px buttons (exceeds minimum 44px)
