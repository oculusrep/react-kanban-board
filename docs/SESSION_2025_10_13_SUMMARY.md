# Quick Summary: Client Selector Improvements - October 13, 2025

## What We Fixed

### 1. Dropdown Z-Index Issue
**Problem**: Selector dropdowns appeared behind map buttons (e.g., "My Location")
**Solution**: Increased z-index from `z-10` to `z-50` on all selector dropdowns

### 2. Client Selector UI Consistency
**Problem**: Client dropdown looked different from Property/Property Unit selectors
**Solution**: Simplified ClientSelector to match PropertySelector styling

### 3. Site Submit Name Auto-Generation
**Problem**: Name wouldn't auto-generate when editing existing site submits or after changing client/property
**Solution**: Modified logic to always regenerate name when client or property changes

### 4. Site Selector Checkbox Removal
**Problem**: Legacy `is_site_selector` checkbox duplicated functionality of new contact roles system
**Solution**: Removed checkbox from UI, keeping database column for safety

## Changes Made

### Files Modified
1. **`src/components/mapping/ClientSelector.tsx`** (-65 lines, +54 lines)

   - Simplified dropdown UI to match PropertySelector
   - Removed submit count badges and extra styling
   - Added text selection on focus
   - Improved input clearing logic

2. **`src/components/PropertySelector.tsx`** (1 line changed)
   - Fixed z-index: `z-10` → `z-50`

3. **`src/components/PropertyUnitSelector.tsx`** (2 lines changed)
   - Fixed z-index: `z-10` → `z-50` (dropdown and empty message)

4. **`src/pages/SiteSubmitDetailsPage.tsx`** (-119 lines, +154 lines)
   - Integrated simplified ClientSelector
   - Fixed auto-generation logic (removed `userEditedName` blocking)
   - Added property name loading for existing site submits
   - Reset `userEditedName` flag after auto-generation

5. **`src/components/ContactFormModal.tsx`** (Removed Site Selector checkbox)
   - Users now use "Add Role" button for Site Selector assignments

6. **`src/components/ContactOverviewTab.tsx`** (Removed Site Selector checkbox)
   - Consistent with new contact roles system

7. **`check_site_selector_migration.sql`** (New verification script)
   - Query to verify migration of is_site_selector data

## User Impact

### Before
- Dropdowns appeared behind map buttons (couldn't click items)
- Client selector had different look/feel than other fields
- Auto-generation stopped working after any edit
- Didn't work on existing site submits

### After
- All dropdowns appear on top of other UI elements
- All lookup fields (Client, Property, Property Unit) look consistent
- Auto-generation always works when changing client or property
- Works for both new and existing site submits
- Manual name edits still respected until next client/property change

## How It Works Now

```
User selects client → Name auto-generates: "[Client] - [Property]"
User selects property → Name auto-generates: "[Client] - [Property]"
User manually types name → Auto-generation paused
User changes client/property → Auto-generation resumes
```
