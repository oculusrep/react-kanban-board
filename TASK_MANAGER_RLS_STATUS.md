# Task Manager - RLS Implementation Status

**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Status:** Implementation Complete - Testing Pending Due to Supabase Outage

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Row Level Security (RLS) Migration
**File:** [migrations/add_user_role_and_activity_rls.sql](migrations/add_user_role_and_activity_rls.sql)

The migration includes:
- **Index creation** on `ovis_role` column (already exists in user table)
- **Enable RLS** on activity table
- **4 RLS Policies:**
  - **SELECT:** Admins see all activities, regular users only see their own (where `owner_id` matches)
  - **INSERT:** Any authenticated user can create activities (owner_id auto-set via trigger)
  - **UPDATE:** Admins can update any activity, users only their own
  - **DELETE:** Admins can delete any activity, users only their own
- **Triggers:**
  - `set_activity_owner_trigger` - Automatically sets `owner_id` to current user on INSERT
  - `set_activity_updated_by_trigger` - Updates `updated_by` field on UPDATE

**Status:** ✅ Created, ⏳ Not yet applied to database (due to Supabase outage)

---

### 2. Frontend Implementation
**File:** [src/pages/TaskDashboardPage.tsx](src/pages/TaskDashboardPage.tsx)

**Changes Made:**

#### Added State (line 58):
```typescript
const [currentUserRole, setCurrentUserRole] = useState<string | null>(null);
```

#### Load User Role (lines 124-130):
```typescript
// Load current user's role
if (user?.email) {
  const currentUser = usersResult.data.find(u => u.email === user.email);
  if (currentUser) {
    setCurrentUserRole(currentUser.ovis_role || null);
  }
}
```

#### Conditional Filter Rendering (lines 985-1002):
```typescript
{/* Assigned To Filter - Only visible to admin users */}
{currentUserRole === 'admin' && (
  <div>
    <label className="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700 mb-1">Assigned To</label>
    <select
      value={filters.assignedTo}
      onChange={(e) => setFilters({ ...filters, assignedTo: e.target.value })}
      className="w-full rounded-md border-gray-300 shadow-sm focus:border-blue-500 focus:ring-blue-500"
    >
      <option value="all">All Users</option>
      <option value="me">My Tasks</option>
      {users.map(user => (
        <option key={user.id} value={user.id}>
          {user.first_name} {user.last_name}
        </option>
      ))}
    </select>
  </div>
)}
```

**Status:** ✅ Complete and deployed

## How It Works

### For Admin Users (ovis_role = 'admin'):
1. ✅ "Assigned To" filter is **visible** in the UI
2. ✅ Can select "All Users", "My Tasks", or specific users
3. ✅ Can see tasks from all users (when "All Users" selected)
4. ✅ Once RLS is applied: Can query/modify all tasks in database

### For Regular Users (ovis_role != 'admin'):
1. ✅ "Assigned To" filter is **hidden** in the UI
2. ✅ Automatically filtered to "My Tasks"
3. ✅ Once RLS is applied: Can only query/modify their own tasks at database level
4. ✅ New tasks automatically assigned to them (via trigger)

---

## Testing Status

### UI Testing (Frontend Only):
**Status:** ✅ Ready to test

**How to Test:**
1. Change your `ovis_role` in Supabase table editor:
   - Set to `'admin'` → Filter should be visible
   - Set to anything else (e.g., `'user'` or `'testing'`) → Filter should be hidden
2. Refresh browser to see changes

**Current Issue:** Supabase experiencing outage, preventing database updates for testing

---

### Database RLS Testing:
**Status:** ⏳ Pending - Migration not yet applied

**To Apply Migration:**
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy contents from [migrations/add_user_role_and_activity_rls.sql](migrations/add_user_role_and_activity_rls.sql)
3. Execute the SQL
4. Test that non-admin users can only see their own tasks

**Current Issue:** Supabase outage preventing SQL execution

## What's Left to Do

### Immediate (When Supabase is back online):
- [ ] Apply the RLS migration in Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Test UI with different roles (admin vs user)
- [ ] Test database-level RLS enforcement
- [ ] Verify triggers auto-set `owner_id` on new tasks

### Optional Future Enhancements:
- [ ] Add UI indicator showing current user's role
- [ ] Add admin badge/icon for admin users
- [ ] Create user management page for admins to assign roles

---

## Files Modified/Created

### Created:
- `migrations/add_user_role_and_activity_rls.sql` - RLS migration SQL
- `toggle-role.sql` - Helper SQL for testing role changes
- `run-migration.js` - Script to check/set admin role (has connection issues)
- `check-users.js` - Script to list all users (has connection issues)
- `check-user-table-constraints.sql` - Debug SQL for checking triggers/policies

### Modified:
- `src/pages/TaskDashboardPage.tsx` - Added role-based filter visibility

---

## Database Schema Notes

### User Table:
- Already has `ovis_role` column (TEXT type)
- No need to add the column - it exists
- Values: `'admin'`, `'user'`, or custom values

### Activity Table:
- Has `owner_id` column (references user.id)
- Will have RLS enabled once migration is applied
- Triggers will auto-populate `owner_id` and `updated_by`

---

## Known Issues

### 1. Supabase Outage (Current):
- Cannot execute SQL in SQL Editor
- Cannot update table values in Table Editor
- Frontend app still works (reads cached data)

### 2. Node.js Script Connection Issues:
- `toggle-my-role.js` fails with "Failed to fetch api.supabase.com"
- `run-migration.js` fails with same error
- Not a critical issue - can use SQL Editor instead

### 3. Database Warnings (Non-blocking):
- Multiple functions have mutable `search_path` warnings
- Leaked password protection disabled
- Postgres version has security patches available
- These are recommendations, not blockers

---

## Testing Checklist (When Supabase is online)

### Phase 1: UI Testing
- [ ] Set role to 'admin' - verify filter visible
- [ ] Set role to 'user' - verify filter hidden
- [ ] Set role to 'testing' - verify filter hidden
- [ ] Set role back to 'admin'

### Phase 2: RLS Migration
- [ ] Apply migration SQL
- [ ] Verify no SQL errors
- [ ] Check policies created: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
- [ ] Check triggers created: `set_activity_owner_trigger`, `set_activity_updated_by_trigger`

### Phase 3: RLS Functionality
- [ ] As admin: Can see all tasks
- [ ] As admin: Can modify any task
- [ ] As user: Can only see own tasks
- [ ] As user: Cannot see other users' tasks
- [ ] As user: Can only modify own tasks
- [ ] Create new task: Verify `owner_id` auto-set to current user
