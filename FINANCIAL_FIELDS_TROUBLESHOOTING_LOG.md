# Financial Fields Troubleshooting Session Log

## Problem Statement
Financial fields (Available Sq Ft, Rent PSF, NNN PSF, Building Sq Ft, Acres) in the property sidebar were added but values disappear on refresh. User can edit them and save, but when refreshing the page, the values don't persist.

## What Was Working
- Property name and address fields work correctly (save and persist)
- Database save operation appears successful in logs
- Form state management during editing session works

## Attempts Made (All Failed)

### 1. PropertyPSFField/PropertySqftField Component Issues
**What I tried:** Initially replaced basic HTML inputs with custom PropertyPSFField and PropertySqftField components for formatting.
**Result:** All field values disappeared completely - even existing values stopped showing.
**Why it failed:** The components had logic inconsistencies in handling null values and display formatting.
**Fix attempted:** Reverted back to basic HTML input elements.

### 2. Form Initialization Logic Changes
**What I tried:** Modified the form initialization useEffect to always load fresh data instead of using cached `shouldUseSavedData` logic.
**Result:** Fields stopped accepting input changes.
**Why it failed:** Broke the documented editable fields pattern by removing the `shouldUseSavedData` logic that prevents form reinitialization after saves.
**Fix attempted:** Restored the original documented pattern.

### 3. UseEffect Dependency Array Changes
**What I tried:** Changed dependency array from `[data, type, lastSavedPropertyData, hasPropertyChanges]` to `[data?.id, type]` to prevent reinitialization on every change.
**Result:** Still didn't work.
**Fix attempted:** Reverted to documented dependencies.

### 4. Database Schema Investigation (Wrong Direction)
**What I tried:** Assumed the financial fields didn't exist in database and attempted to add them to migration script.
**Why this was wrong:** User corrected me - the fields already exist in the database.
**Fix attempted:** Reverted all migration script changes.

### 5. PropertyLayer Query Updates
**What I tried:** Added financial fields to the SELECT statements in PropertyLayer.tsx since they were missing from the queries.
**Result:** User said this still doesn't work.
**Current status:** This was the last attempt.

## Root Cause Analysis - What's Likely Wrong

The fundamental issue is probably **NOT** in the form logic, database schema, or PropertyLayer queries. Based on the symptoms, the most likely issues are:

### 1. Database Save Not Actually Working
- Logs show "success" but the database update might be failing silently
- The financial fields might not be getting included in the actual UPDATE query
- Check the `handleSavePropertyChanges` function in PinDetailsSlideout.tsx around lines 340-410

### 2. Property Data Loading Issue
- Even with PropertyLayer queries updated, the specific property being opened might be loaded from a different source
- The `data` prop passed to PinDetailsSlideout might come from a different query that doesn't include financial fields
- Need to trace where the `data` prop originates when clicking on a property

### 3. Form State Initialization Timing
- The form might be initializing before the full property data is loaded
- Race condition between component mount and data loading
- The `shouldUseSavedData` logic might be incorrectly preventing fresh data loading

## Next Session Recommendations

### 1. First Debug Step: Verify Database Save
```typescript
// Add this logging in handleSavePropertyChanges after the supabase update:
console.log('üìù Raw update response:', { data: updatedData, error });
console.log('üîç Updated data financial fields:', {
  rent_psf: updatedData?.rent_psf,
  nnn_psf: updatedData?.nnn_psf,
  available_sqft: updatedData?.available_sqft
});
```

### 2. Second Debug Step: Verify Data Loading
```typescript
// Add this in the form initialization useEffect:
console.log('üì• Raw property data:', propertyData);
console.log('üí∞ Financial fields in data:', {
  rent_psf: propertyData.rent_psf,
  nnn_psf: propertyData.nnn_psf,
  available_sqft: propertyData.available_sqft
});
```

### 3. Verify Database State Directly
Check the database directly to confirm:
- Do the financial fields exist in the property table?
- Are values actually being saved when the update runs?
- Are values being returned when property is queried?

## Files Modified This Session
- `/workspaces/react-kanban-board/src/components/mapping/slideouts/PinDetailsSlideout.tsx` - Form initialization logic
- `/workspaces/react-kanban-board/src/components/mapping/layers/PropertyLayer.tsx` - Added financial fields to SELECT queries
- `/workspaces/react-kanban-board/src/components/property/PropertyPSFField.tsx` - Added compact prop (reverted)
- `/workspaces/react-kanban-board/src/components/property/PropertySqftField.tsx` - Added compact prop (reverted)

## Current State
- Basic HTML inputs are being used (not custom components)
- PropertyLayer queries include financial fields
- Form follows documented editable fields pattern
- Financial fields still don't persist on refresh

## Likely Next Steps
1. Debug database save operation with detailed logging
2. Trace data flow from database ‚Üí PropertyLayer ‚Üí PinDetailsSlideout
3. Verify timing of form initialization vs data loading
4. Check if there are multiple sources loading property data

The issue is likely in the data persistence or loading pipeline, not the form UI logic.
