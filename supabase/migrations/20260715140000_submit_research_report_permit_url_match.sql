-- Dedupe hard-match: also flag a candidate as matching an existing
-- municipal_project when their permit_url is identical.
--
-- Context (feature/research-dedupe-safety-net): the prior dup detection matched
-- only on normalized (project_name, address) WITHIN the resolved municipality.
-- On a "deep follow-up" run that reaches further back in time, a P&Z / permit
-- record a prior run already committed can resurface — but under a slightly
-- different project name, a reformatted address, or (after annexation) a
-- different jurisdiction. Name/address matching misses all three.
--
-- permit_url is the strongest available identifier: it's a link to a specific
-- permit/application record, effectively a globally-unique key. Matching on it
-- is municipality-INDEPENDENT, so it catches the cross-boundary "annexation
-- bleed" case that the municipality-scoped name/address match cannot.
--
-- This changes ONLY the matched_existing_id computation (adds a stronger,
-- municipality-agnostic permit_url probe ahead of the existing name/address
-- probe via COALESCE). Everything else — the off-checklist guard, the
-- idempotency/replace-on-resubmit logic, the defensive casts — is carried
-- forward verbatim from 20260714140000_submit_research_report_idempotent.sql,
-- which this replaces.
