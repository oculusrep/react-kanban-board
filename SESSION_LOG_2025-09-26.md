# Session Log - September 26, 2025

## Overview
This session focused on improving the geocoding system and fixing session pin visibility issues in the React-based mapping application.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. City Field Population Issues ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: City field wasn't populating correctly during reverse geocoding
- OpenStreetMap was returning county names ("Cobb County") instead of city names
- Neighborhood names ("Gates on Woodlawn") were being used instead of actual cities
- No validation that city names corresponded to ZIP codes

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive fallback system
- Added Google Geocoding API fallback when OSM fails
- Enhanced city detection to identify unreliable names (neighborhoods, shopping centers)
- Added ZIP code validation to ensure city-ZIP correspondence
- Created intelligent pattern detection for non-city locations

### 2. Session Pin Visibility Bug ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Session pins (recently created properties) only showed when Properties layer was OFF
- When "All Properties" was toggled ON, new session pins disappeared
- Users lost track of recently created properties

**Solution**: Fixed visibility logic
- Session pins now show regardless of Properties layer state
- Red session pins have higher z-index (1000) to appear above regular pins
- Persist until browser tab closes or manual clear

## Technical Implementations

### Enhanced Geocoding Service (`src/services/geocodingService.ts`)

#### Google API Fallback System
```typescript
async reverseGeocodeWithGoogle(lat: number, lng: number): Promise<GeocodeResult | GeocodeError>
```
- Dedicated method for Google reverse geocoding
- Extracts accurate city names from Google's address components
- Fallback when OSM data is unreliable

#### Intelligent City Detection
Enhanced pattern recognition to identify unreliable city names:
- County names: "Cobb", "County"
- Shopping centers: "Mall", "Plaza", "Shopping Center"
- Neighborhoods: "Gates on Woodlawn", "Village of X"
- Subdivisions: "The Commons", "Park", "Ridge", "Hills"
- Residential: "Apartments", "Condos", "Townhomes"
- Patterns: Names with numbers, very long names (>20 chars)

#### ZIP Code Validation
```typescript
private async validateCityZipCorrespondence(city: string, zip: string): Promise<boolean>
```
- Validates city names against ZIP code postal areas
- Uses Google's geocoding API to verify ZIP → City mapping
- Triggers fallback when city-ZIP mismatch detected

#### Enhanced Logging
Comprehensive console logging for debugging:
- `🔄 OSM city not reliable (detected neighborhood/shopping center), trying Google Geocoding API...`
- `🔍 ZIP 30068 validation: expected city "Gates on Woodlawn", ZIP maps to "Marietta"`
- `❌ City-ZIP mismatch detected`
- `✅ Using Google result for better city data`

### Session Pin Visibility Fix (`src/components/mapping/layers/PropertyLayer.tsx`)

#### Before (Buggy Logic)
```typescript
marker.setMap(!isVisible ? map : null); // Only show when layer OFF
```

#### After (Fixed Logic)
```typescript
marker.setMap(map); // Always show session markers
```

**Key Changes:**
- Session markers always visible regardless of Properties layer state
- Higher z-index ensures they appear above regular property pins
- Distinctive red color prevents confusion with regular pins

## User Experience Improvements

### Geocoding Accuracy
- **Before**: "Cobb County" or "Gates on Woodlawn" in city field
- **After**: "Marietta" (correct city corresponding to ZIP code)

### Session Pin Management
- **Before**: Session pins disappeared when Properties layer enabled
- **After**: Session pins persist and remain visible in all states

### Data Integrity
- City names now correspond to actual postal areas
- ZIP code validation ensures geographic accuracy
- Fallback system provides robust data quality

## API Integration

### Google Geocoding API Usage
- **Primary**: Forward geocoding (address → coordinates)
- **Fallback**: Reverse geocoding (coordinates → address) when OSM fails
- **Validation**: ZIP code → city mapping verification

### OpenStreetMap Nominatim
- **Primary**: Reverse geocoding with rate limiting
- **Advantages**: Free, good street address extraction
- **Limitations**: Inconsistent city name quality

## Security Considerations
- Google API keys properly secured in environment variables
- Previous security incident (exposed keys) already resolved
- API key usage optimized to minimize quota consumption

## Console Output Examples

### Successful Geocoding with Fallback
```
🏙️ Address components from OSM: {road: 'Lakeshore Drive Northeast', neighbourhood: 'Gates on Woodlawn', county: 'Cobb County', ...}
🏙️ Extracted city from OSM: Gates on Woodlawn
📮 ZIP code from OSM: 30068
🔄 OSM city not reliable (detected neighborhood/shopping center), trying Google Geocoding API...
🗺️ Google Geocoding result: {formatted_address: '371 Lakeshore Dr NE, Marietta, GA 30067, USA', ...}
🏙️ Google extracted city: Marietta
✅ Using Google result for better city data
```

### ZIP Code Validation
```
🔍 ZIP 30068 validation: expected city "Gates on Woodlawn", ZIP maps to "Marietta"
❌ City-ZIP mismatch detected
🔄 OSM city not reliable (city-ZIP code mismatch), trying Google Geocoding API...
```

### Session Pin Management
```
🆕 Creating session markers for recently created properties... ['08351fb6-c0b3-49ab-bd46-4e785987127a', '368ea84c-d30a-48e6-ad55-d4e5190ff7ba']
✅ Created 2 session markers
```

## Performance Considerations
- Rate limiting implemented for both Google and OSM APIs
- Intelligent fallback reduces unnecessary API calls
- Session markers efficiently managed with proper cleanup

## Future Enhancements
- Consider caching ZIP → City mappings to reduce API calls
- Potential integration with additional geocoding services
- Enhanced neighborhood detection patterns

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test various locations to verify city-ZIP correspondence
2. Verify session pin visibility in all layer states
3. Monitor API quota usage with new fallback system
4. Test edge cases with unusual address formats
